  abstract = {We describe a novel adaptive ray tracing scheme to solve the equation of radiative transfer around point sources in hydrodynamical simulations. The angular resolution adapts to the local hydrodynamical resolution and hence is of use for adaptive meshes as well as adaptive smooth particle hydrodynamical simulations. Recursive creation of rays ensures ease of implementation. The multiple radial integrations needed to solve the time-dependent radiative transfer are speeded up significantly using a quad-tree once the rays are cast. Simplifications advantageous for methods with one radiation source are briefly discussed. The suggested method is easily generalized to speed up Monte Carlo radiative transfer techniques. In summary, a nearly optimal use of long characteristics is presented and aspects of its implementation and comparison with other methods are given.},

  abstract = {We describe results from a fully self-consistent three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in the Universe. In current models of structure formation, dark matter initially dominates, and pregalactic objects form because of gravitational instability from small initial density perturbations. As they assemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrational lines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matter potential well. The high-redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. As the dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a dense core of {$\sim$}100M {$\odot$} (whereM {$\odot$} is the mass of the Sun) undergoes rapid contraction. At particle number densities greater than 109 per cubic centimeter, a 1M {$\odot$} protostellar core becomes fully molecular as a result of three-body H2formation. Contrary to analytical expectations, this process does not lead to renewed fragmentation and only one star is formed. The calculation is stopped when optical depth effects become important, leaving the final mass of the fully formed star somewhat uncertain. At this stage the protostar is accreting material very rapidly ({$\sim$}10-2 M {$\odot$}year-1). Radiative feedback from the star will not only halt its growth but also inhibit the formation of other stars in the same pregalactic object (at least until the first star ends its life, presumably as a supernova). We conclude that at most one massive (M {$\gg$} 1 M {$\odot$}) metal-free star forms per pregalactic halo, consistent with recent abundance measurements of metal-poor galactic halo stars.},

The two commonly used techniques of grid and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) show striking differences in their ability to model processes that are fundamentally important across many areas of astrophysics. Whilst Eulerian grid based methods are able to resolve and treat important dynamical instabilities, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz or Rayleigh-Taylor, these processes are poorly or not at all resolved by existing SPH techniques. We show that the reason for this is that SPH, at least in its standard implementation, introduces spurious pressure forces on particles in regions where there are steep density gradients. This results in a boundary gap of the size of an SPH smoothing kernel radius over which interactions are severely damped.},

  abstract = {We study the effect of starlight from the first stars on the ability of other minihaloes in their neighbourhood to form additional stars. The first stars in the cold dark matter ( CDM) universe are believed to have formed in minihaloes of total mass {$\sim$}105\textendash 6 M{$\odot$} at redshifts z 20, when molecular hydrogen (H2) formed and cooled the dense gas at their centres, leading to gravitational collapse. Simulations suggest that the Population III (Pop III) stars thus formed were massive ({$\sim$}100 M{$\odot$}) and luminous enough in ionizing radiation to cause an ionization front (I-front) to sweep outward, through their host minihalo and beyond, into the intergalactic medium. Our previous work suggested that this I-front was trapped when it encountered other, nearby minihaloes, and that it failed to penetrate the dense gas at their centres within the lifetime of the Pop III stars ( 3 Myr). The question of what the dynamical consequences were for these target minihaloes, of their exposure to the ionizing and dissociating starlight from the Pop III star requires further study, however. Towards this end, we have performed a series of detailed, one-dimensional (1D), radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to answer the question of whether star formation in these surrounding minihaloes was triggered or suppressed by radiation from the first stars. We have varied the distance to the source (and, hence, the flux) and the mass and evolutionary stage of the target haloes to quantify this effect. We find (1) trapping of the I-front and its transformation from R-type to D-type, preceded by a shock front; (2) photoevaporation of the ionized gas (i.e. all gas originally located outside the trapping radius); (3) formation of an H2 precursor shell which leads the I-front, stimulated by partial photoionization; and (4) the shock-induced formation of H2 in the minihalo neutral core when the shock speeds up and partially ionizes the gas. The fate of the neutral core is mostly determined by the response of the core to this shock front, which leads to molecular cooling and collapse that, when compared to the same halo without external radiation, is (a) expedited, or (b) delayed, or (c) unaltered, or (d) reversed or prevented, depending upon the flux (i.e. distance to the source) and the halo mass and evolutionary stage. When collapse is expedited, star formation in neighbouring minihaloes or in merging subhaloes within the host minihalo sometimes occurs within the lifetime of the first star. Roughly speaking, most haloes that were destined to cool, collapse and form stars in the absence of external radiation are found to do so even when exposed to the first Pop III star in their neighbourhood, while those that would not have done so are still not able to. A widely held view that the first Pop III stars must exert either positive or negative feedback on the formation of the stars in neighbouring minihaloes should, therefore, be revisited.},

  abstract = {Simulations predict that the first stars in an LCDM universe formed at redshifts z{$>$}20 in minihalos with masses of about 10\^6 M\_sun. We have studied their radiative feedback by simulating the propagation of ionization fronts (I-fronts) created by these first Population III stars (M\_* = 15-500 M\_sun) at z=20, within the density field of a cosmological simulation of primordial star formation, outward thru the host minihalo and into the surrounding gas. A three-dimensional ray-tracing calculation tracks the I-front once the H II region evolves a "champagne flow'' inside the minihalo, after the early D-type I-front detaches from the shock and runs ahead, becoming R-type. We take account of the hydrodynamical back-reaction by an approximate model of the central wind. We find that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from the host halo increases with stellar mass, with 0.7 {$<$} f\_esc {$<$}0.9 for 80 {$<$} M\_*/M\_sun {$<$} 500. To quantify the ionizing efficiency of these stars as they begin cosmic reionization, we find that, for M\_* {$>$} 80 M\_sun, the ratio of gas mass ionized to stellar mass is \textasciitilde 60,000, roughly half the number of ionizing photons released per stellar baryon. Nearby minihalos are shown to trap the I-front, so their centers remain neutral. This is contrary to the recent suggestion that these stars would trigger formation of a second generation by fully ionizing neighboring minihalos, stimulating H\_2 formation in their cores. Finally, we discuss how the evacuation of gas from the host halo reduces the growth and luminosity of "miniquasars'' that may form from black hole remnants of the first stars.},

We compute the UV LF at z {$\sim$} 7 using the combined galaxy sample and perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine the best-fit Schechter parameters. We are able to reliably constrain the LF down to an absolute magnitude of MUV = -15.25, which corresponds to 0.005 L{$\star$}. More importantly, we find that the faint-end slope remains steep down to this magnitude limit with We find a characteristic magnitude of and log({$\phi\star$}) = Our results confirm the most recent results in deep blank fields but extend the LF measurements more than two magnitudes deeper. The UV LF at z {$\sim$} 8 is not very well constrained below MUV = -18 owing to the small number statistics and incompleteness uncertainties. To assess the contribution of galaxies to cosmic reionization, we derive the UV luminosity density at z {$\sim$} 7 by integrating the UV LF down to an observational limit of MUV = -15. We show that our determination of log({$\rho$}UV) = 26.2 {$\pm$} 0.13 (erg s-1 Hz-1 Mpc-3) can be sufficient to maintain reionization with an escape fraction of ionizing radiation of fesc = 10\%\textendash 15\%.

  abstract = {We measure the anisotropy of dark matter flows on small scales (\textasciitilde 500  kpc) in the near environment of haloes using a large set of simulations. We rely on two different approaches to quantify the anisotropy of the cosmic infall: we measure the flows at the virial radius of the haloes while describing the infalling matter via fluxes through a spherical shell; and we measure the spatial and kinematical distributions of satellites and substructures around haloes detected by the subclump finder ADAPTAHOP described for the first time in the appendix. The two methods are found to be in agreement both qualitatively and quantitatively via one- and two-point statistics. The peripheral and advected momenta are correlated with the spin of the embedded halo at levels of 30 and 50 per cent. The infall takes place preferentially in the plane perpendicular to the direction defined by the spin of the halo. We computed the excess of equatorial accretion both through rings and via a harmonic expansion of the infall. The level of anisotropy of infalling matter is found to be \textasciitilde 15 per cent. The substructures have their spin orthogonal to their velocity vector in the rest frame of the halo at a level of about 5 per cent, suggestive of an image of a flow along filamentary structures, which provides an explanation for the measured anisotropy. Using a `synthetic' stacked halo, it is shown that the positions and orientations of satellites relative to the direction of spin of the halo are not random even in projection. The average ellipticity of stacked haloes is 10 per cent, while the alignment excess in projection reaches 2 per cent. All measured correlations are fitted by a simple three-parameter model. We conclude that a halo does not see its environment as an isotropic perturbation, we investigate how the anisotropy is propagated inwards using perturbation theory, and we discuss briefly the implications for weak lensing, warps and the thickness of galactic discs.},

All included radiative feedback processes are extensively tested. We also compare our module to dedicated photodissociation region (PDR) codes and find good agreement in our modelled hydrogen species once our radiative transfer solution reaches equilibrium.

In the next few years, the SKA pathfinders will provide statistical measurements of this signal, such as its power spectrum. Within one decade, SKA should produce a full tomography of the signal. Numerical simulations predicting these observations are necessary to optimize the design of the instruments and help in the interpretation of the data. Simulations are reaching a reasonable level in terms of scale range, but still often rely on simplifications to compute the strength of the signal. The main difficulty is the computation of the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen which depends on the gas kinetic temperature and on the level of the local Lyman-\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} flux (The Wouthuysen-Field effect). A assumption is usual. However, this assumption does not apply early in the reionization history, or even later in the history as long as the sources of X-rays are too weak to heat the intergalactic medium significantly. This work presents the first EoR numerical simulations including, beside dynamics and ionizing continuum radiative transfer, a self-consistent treatment of the Ly-\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} radiative transfer. This allows us to compute the spin temperature more accurately. We use two different box sizes, and , and a star source model. Using the redshift dependence of average quantities, maps, and power spectra, we quantify the effect of using different assumptions to compute the spin temperature and the influence of the box size. The first effect comes from allowing for a signal in absorption (i.e. not making the approximation). The magnitude of this effect depends on the amount of heating by hydrodynamic shocks and X-rays in the intergalactic medium (IGM). With our source model we have little heating so regions seen in absorption survive almost until the end of reionization. The second effects comes from using the real, local, Lyman-\emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$} flux. This effect is important for an average ionization fraction of less than \textasciitilde : it changes the overall amplitude of the signal, and adds its own fluctuations to the power spectrum.}}}},

We carefully tally all apsis points and use them to distinguish haloes that are infalling for the first time from those that occupy more evolved orbits. We find that roughly 21 per cent of resolved subhaloes within a host's virial radius are currently on first infall, and have not yet reached their first orbital pericentre; roughly 44 per cent are still approaching their first apocentre after infall. For the range of host masses studied, roughly half of all accreted systems were pre-processed prior to infall, and about 20 per cent were accreted in groups. We confirm that the entire population of accreted subhaloes \textendash{} often referred to as ``associated'' subhaloes \textendash{} extends far beyond the virial radii of their hosts, with roughly half currently residing at distances that exceed {$\approx$} 1.2 \texttimes{} r200. Many of these backsplash haloes have gained orbital energy since infall, and occupy extreme orbits that carry them well past their initial turnaround radii. Such extreme orbits are created during the initial accretion and dissolution of loosely bound groups, but also through penetrating encounters between subhaloes on subsequent orbits. The same processes may also give rise to unexpectedly abrupt losses of orbital energy. These effects combine, giving rise to a large variation in the ratio of sequent apocentres for accreted systems. We find that, within 2 virial radii from host centres, the concentrations of first-infall haloes are remarkably similar those of isolated field haloes, whereas backsplash haloes, as well as systems that were pre-processed, are considerably more concentrated.},

  abstract = {We determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) using an area of 143 deg2 from the first three years of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. The magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r {$<$} 19.4 mag over two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. The GSMF is determined from a sample of 5210 galaxies using a densitycorrected maximum volume method. This efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number density versus redshift. With H0 = 70 km s-1 Mpc-1, the GSMF is well described between 108 and 1011.5M{$\odot$} using a double Schechter function with M{${_\ast}$} = 1010.66M{$\odot$}, {$\varphi{_\ast}$}1 = 3.96 \texttimes{} 10-3 Mpc-3, {$\alpha$}1 = -0.35, {$\varphi{_\ast}$}2 = 0.79 \texttimes{} 10-3 Mpc-3 and {$\alpha$}2 = -1.47. This result is more robust to uncertainties in the flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sample (r {$<$} 17.8 mag). The upturn in the GSMF is also seen directly in the i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions. Accurately measuring the GSMF below 108M{$\odot$} is possible within the GAMA survey volume but as expected requires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from low surface-brightness galaxies.},

  abstract = {Feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (BHs), active galactic nuclei (AGNs), is now a cornerstone of galaxy formation models. In this work, we present radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of radiative AGN feedback using the novel arepo-rt code. A central BH emits radiation at a constant luminosity and drives an outflow via radiation pressure on dust grains. Utilizing an isolated Navarro\textendash Frenk\textendash White (NFW) halo we validate our set-up in the single- and multiscattering regimes, with the simulated shock front propagation in excellent agreement with the expected analytic result. For a spherically symmetric NFW halo, an examination of the simulated outflow properties with radiation collimation demonstrates a decreasing mass outflow rate and momentum flux, but increasing kinetic power and outflow velocity with decreasing opening angle. We then explore the impact of a central disc galaxy and the assumed dust model on the outflow properties. The contraction of the halo during the galaxy's formation and modelling the production of dust grains result in a factor 100 increase in the halo's optical depth. Radiation then couples momentum more efficiently to the gas, driving a stronger shock and producing a mass-loaded \$\textbackslash sim \textbackslash!10\^\{3\}\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot \}\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{yr\}\^\{-1\}\$ outflow with a velocity of \$\textbackslash sim \textbackslash!2000\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{km\}\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{s\}\^\{-1\}\$. However, the inclusion of dust destruction mechanisms, like thermal sputtering, leads to the rapid destruction of dust grains within the outflow, reducing its properties below the initial NFW halo. We conclude that radiative AGN feedback can drive outflows, but a thorough numerical and physical treatment is required to assess its true impact.},

  abstract = {Navarro, Frenk, \&amp; White have recently found numerically that the density profile of dark-matter halos can be described by a universal two-parameter function over a broad range of halo masses. The profile is singular, approaching the halo center with {$\rho\lbrace$}prop.to\vphantom\{\}r\^-1\^. It had been argued previously that radially distorted, gravitationally lensed images of background sources in galaxy clusters, so-called radial arcs, required a flat core in the cluster density profile. Such radial arcs have so far been detected in two galaxy clusters, in apparent contradiction with a singular density profile. I show here that the profile suggested by Navarro et al. can produce radial arcs despite its central singularity, and describe how the two parameters of the profile can be determined in clusters where radial and tangential arcs are observed. I then apply this analysis to the two clusters where radial arcs were detected. In both cases, the redshifts of the radial arcs are yet unknown, hence definitive conclusions on the profile parameters cannot yet be drawn. Numerically determined values for the parameters of cluster-sized halos can, however, be used to predict the range of the unknown arc redshifts, thus providing a direct observational test for the proposed density profile. A potential difficulty with the profile is that the radial magnification of tangential arcs is large, hence tangential arcs should be thick or their sources should be very thin in the radial direction.},

Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and cosmic star formation rates (CSFRs) from z = 0 to z = 8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo\textendash subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 1012 M are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z {$\sim$} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z {$\sim$} 1\textendash 1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in {$\Lambda$}CDM.

Our algorithm has demonstrated the ability to improve both the completeness (through detecting and inserting otherwise missing halos) and purity (through detecting and removing spurious objects) of both merger trees and halo catalogs. In addition, our method is able to robustly measure the self-consistency of halo finders; it is the first to directly measure the uncertainties in halo positions, halo velocities, and the halo mass function for a given halo finder based on consistency between snapshots in cosmological simulations. We use this algorithm to generate merger trees for two large simulations (Bolshoi and Consuelo) and evaluate two halo finders (ROCKSTAR and BDM). We find that both the ROCKSTAR and BDM halo finders track halos extremely well; in both, the number of halos which do not have physically consistent progenitors is at the 1\%-2\% level across all halo masses.

Our method is massively parallel (up to 10\^5 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations ({$>$}10\^10 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper (Knebe et al 2011) has shown Rockstar to have class-leading recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery as compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results which demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or satellite average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km/s at z=0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar .},

  abstract = {We have used a combination of high resolution cosmological N-body simulations and semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation to investigate the processes that determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in cold dark matter (CDM) models and its relation to the spatial distribution of dark matter. The galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency with which galaxies form in haloes of different mass. In small mass haloes, galaxy formation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes, whereas in large mass haloes, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of the gas. As a result, the mass-to-light ratio of haloes has a deep minimum at the halo mass, \textasciitilde 1012Msolar, associated with L* galaxies, where galaxy formation is most efficient. This dependence of galaxy formation efficiency on halo mass leads to a scale-dependent bias in the distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. On large scales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to the bias in the distribution of massive haloes. On small scales, the correlation function is determined by the interplay between various effects including the spatial exclusion of dark matter haloes, the distribution function of the number of galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent, dynamical friction. Remarkably, these processes conspire to produce a correlation function in a flat, {$\Omega$}0=0.3, CDM model that is close to a power law over nearly four orders of magnitude in amplitude. This model agrees well with the correlation function of galaxies measured in the automated-plate measurement survey. On small scales, the model galaxies are less strongly clustered than the dark matter, whereas on large scales they trace the occupied haloes. Our clustering predictions are robust to changes in the parameters of the galaxy formation model, provided only those models which match the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function are considered.},

By populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD models, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the HOD. The galaxy correlation function responds to different aspects of P(N|M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed power-law form of {$\xi$}g(r) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters, implying a strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success of numerical and semianalytic models in reproducing this form is entirely nontrivial. Other clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the bispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise velocity dispersion, and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of HOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias. We outline a strategy for determining the HOD empirically from redshift survey data. This method starts from an assumed cosmological model, but we argue that cosmological and HOD parameters will have nondegenerate effects on galaxy clustering, so that a substantially incorrect cosmological model will not reproduce the observations for any choice of HOD. Empirical determinations of the HOD as a function of galaxy type from the Two-Degree Field (2dF) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift surveys will provide a detailed target for theories of galaxy formation, insight into the origin of galaxy properties, and sharper tests of cosmological models.},

The proposed schemes suit very well the family of high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods and the recently proposed class of ADER-TR schemes, whose orders of accuracy define decreasing sequences of Courant numbers, as the order of accuracy increases. The centred methods of this paper are stable in 2D and 3D in the frame of simultaneous updating formulae, unlike other centred methods, such as 1D FORCE, which are not. Furthermore, the schemes are highly accurate for slowly-moving waves, which is precisely the kind of waves that traditional centred methods smear disastrously. Additional features of the proposed schemes include ease of implementation and applicability to any hyperbolic system either in conservative or non-conservative form. Here, the proposed schemes are analysed and computationally assessed through a suite of test problems for a linear model system, for the Euler equations in one and two space dimensions, and for the Baer-Nunziato equations for compressible two-phase flow. A new parametric class of semi-implicit numerical schemes for a level set advection equation on Cartesian grids is derived and analyzed. An accuracy and a stability study is provided for a linear advection equation with a variable velocity using partial Lax\textendash Wendroff procedure and numerical von Neumann stability analysis. The obtained semi-implicit {$\kappa$}-scheme is 2nd order accurate in space and time in any dimensional case when using a dimension by dimension extension of the one-dimensional scheme that is not the case for analogous fully explicit or fully implicit {$\kappa$}-schemes. A further improvement is obtained by using so-called Corner Transport Upwind extension in two-dimensional case. The extended semi-implicit {$\kappa$}-scheme with a specific (velocity dependent) value of {$\kappa$} is 3rd order accurate in space and time for a constant advection velocity, and it is unconditional stable according to the numerical von Neumann stability analysis for the linear advection equation in general.},

  abstract = {Cosmological simulations require the use of a multiple time-stepping scheme. Without such a scheme, cosmological simulations would be impossible due to their high level of dynamic range; over eleven orders of magnitude in density. Such a large dynamic range leads to a range of over four orders of magnitude in time-step, which presents a significant loadbalancing challenge. In this work, the extreme adaptivity that cosmological simulations present is tackled in three main ways through the use of the code SWIFT. First, an adaptive mesh is used to ensure that only the relevant particles are interacted in a given time-step. Second, task-based parallelism is used to ensure efficient load-balancing within a single node, using pthreads and SIMD vectorisation. Finally, a domain decomposition strategy is presented, using the graph domain decomposition library METIS, that bisects the work that must be performed by the simulation between nodes using MPI. These three strategies are shown to give SWIFT near-perfect weak-scaling characteristics, only losing 25\% performance when scaling from 1 to 4096 cores on a representative problem, whilst being more than 30x faster than the de-facto standard Gadget-2 code.},

  abstract = {Early galaxies were the radiation source for reionization, with the photoheating feedback from the reionization process expected to reduce the efficiency of star formation in low mass haloes. Hence, to fully understand reionization and galaxy formation, we must study their impact on each other. The THESAN project has so far aimed to study the impact of galaxy formation physics on reionization, but here we present the new THESAN simulations with a factor 50 higher resolution (\$m\_\{\textbackslash rm b\} \textbackslash approx 10\^4\$\textasciitilde M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$) that aim to self-consistently study the back-reaction of reionization on galaxies. By resolving haloes with virial temperatures \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\} {$<$} 10\^4\$\textasciitilde K, we are able to demonstrate that simplistic, spatially-uniform, reionization models are not sufficient to study early galaxy evolution. Comparing the self-consistent THESAN model (employing fully coupled radiation hydrodynamics) to a uniform UV background, we are able to show that galaxies in THESAN are predicted to be larger in physical extent (by a factor \$\textbackslash sim 2\$), less metal enriched (by \$\textbackslash sim 0.2\$\textasciitilde dex), and less abundant (by a factor \$\textbackslash sim 10\$ at \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm 1500\}\textasciitilde =\textasciitilde -10\$) by \$z=5\$. We show that differences in star formation and enrichment patterns lead to significantly different predictions for star formation in low mass haloes, low-metallicity star formation, and even the occupation fraction of haloes. We posit that cosmological galaxy formation simulations aiming to study early galaxy formation \$z rsim 3\$ must employ a spatially inhomogeneous UV background to accurately reproduce galaxy properties.},

In pursuit of model-independent constraints on the properties of the ionizing sources, we determine the empirical evolution of the cosmic ionizing emissivity. We use a simple two-parameter model to map out the evolution in the emissivity at z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 6 from the new Planck optical depth {$\tau$} measurements, from the constraints provided by quasar absorption spectra and from the prevalence of Ly{$\alpha$} emission in z {$\sim$} 7\textendash 8 galaxies. We find the redshift evolution in the emissivity required by the observations to be ( for a flat prior), largely independent of the assumed clumping factor CH ii and entirely independent of the nature of the ionizing sources. The trend in is well-matched by the evolution of the galaxy UV-luminosity density () to a magnitude limit {$\greaterequivlnt-$}13 mag, suggesting that galaxies are the sources that drive the reionization of the universe. The role of galaxies is further strengthened by the conversion from the UV luminosity density {$\rho$}UV to being possible for physically plausible values of the escape fraction fesc, the Lyman-continuum photon production efficiency {$\xi$}ion, and faint-end cut-off Mlim to the luminosity function. Quasars/active galactic nuclei appear to match neither the redshift evolution nor normalization of the ionizing emissivity. Based on the inferred evolution in the ionizing emissivity, we estimate that the z {$\sim$} 10 UV-Iuminosity density is 8-4+15\texttimes{} lower than at z {$\sim$} 6, consistent with the observations. The present approach of contrasting the inferred evolution of the ionizing emissivity with that of the galaxy UV luminosity density adds to the growing observational evidence that faint, star-forming galaxies drive the reionization of the universe.},

  abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z {$>$} 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z \textasciitilde{} 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z \textasciitilde{} 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

Many studies have used simulations of such interactions to investigate the effect of particular physical processes, but the impact of the choice of hydrodynamics solver has largely been overlooked. Here we study the cloud-wind interaction, also known as the "blob test", using seven different hydrodynamics solvers: Three flavours of SPH, a moving mesh, adaptive mesh refinement and two meshless schemes. The evolution of masses in dense gas and intermediate-temperature gas, as well as the covering fraction of intermediate-temperature gas, are systematically compared for initial density contrasts of 10 and 100, and four numerical resolutions. To isolate the differences due to the hydrodynamics solvers, we use non-radiative simulations without physical conduction. We find large differences between these methods. SPH methods show slower dispersal of the cloud, particularly for the higher density contrast, but faster convergence, especially for the lower density contrast. Predictions for the intermediate-temperature gas differ particularly strongly, also between non-SPH codes, and converge most slowly. We conclude that the hydrodynamical interaction between a dense cloud and a supersonic wind remains an unsolved problem. Studies aiming to understand the physics or observational signatures of cloud-wind interactions should test the robustness of their results by comparing different hydrodynamics solvers.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 \AA{} to 160 {$\mu$}m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

We provide halo mass (M500) estimates for each of these groups derived from a calibration between the optical richness of bright galaxies (Mr -20.5) within 1 Mpc, and X-ray-derived mass for a small subset of 129 groups and clusters with X-ray measurements. For 20 157 high-mass groups and clusters with M500 {$>$} 1013.7 M{$\odot$}, we find that the catalogue has a purity of {$>$} 97 per cent and a completeness of {$\sim$} 90 per cent. We derive the mean (stacked) surface number density profiles of galaxies as a function of total halo mass in different mass bins. We find that derived profiles can be well-described by a projected NFW profile with a concentration parameter ( c {$\equiv$} r200/rs {$\approx$} 2.6) that is approximately a factor of two lower than that of the dark matter (as predicted by Nbody cosmological simulations) and nearly independent of halo mass. Interestingly, in spite of the difference in shape between the galaxy and dark matter radial distributions, both exhibit a high degree of self-similarity. We also stack the satellite profiles based on other observables, namely redshift, BCG luminosity, and satellite luminosity and colour. We see no evidence for strong variation in profile shape with redshift over the range we probe or with BCG luminosity (or BCG luminosity fraction), but we do find a strong dependence on satellite luminosity and colours, in agreement with previous studies. A self-consistent comparison to several recent semi-analytic models of galaxy formation indicates that: (1) beyond {$\approx$} 0.3r500 current models are able to reproduce both the shape and normalisation of the satellite profiles; and (2) within {$\approx$} 0.3r500 the predicted profiles are sensitive to the details of the satellite-BCG merger timescale calculation. The former is a direct result of the models being tuned to match the global galaxy luminosity function combined with the assumption that the satellite galaxies do not suffer significant tidal stripping, even though their surrounding dark matter haloes can be removed through this process. Combining our results with measurements of the intracluster light should provide a way to inform theoretical models on the efficacy of the tidal stripping and merging processes.},

We explore a three-parameter model in which the number of LBGs per dark halo scales like a power law in the halo mass: N(M)=(M/M1)S for M{$>$}Mmin. Here, Mmin is the minimum mass halo that can host an LBG, M1 is a normalization parameter, associated with the mass above which haloes host more than one observed LBG, and S determines the strength of the mass-dependence. We show how these three parameters are constrained by three observable properties of LBGs: the number density, the large-scale bias and the fraction of objects in close pairs. Given these three quantities, the three unknown model parameters may be estimated analytically, allowing a full exploration of parameter space. As an example, we assume a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology and consider the observed properties of a recent sample of spectroscopically confirmed LBGs. We find that the favoured range for our model parameters is Mmin\textasciitilde =(0.4-8)\texttimes 1010h- 1Msolar, M1\textasciitilde =(6-10)\texttimes 1012h- 1Msolar, and 0.9{$<\sptilde$}S{$<\sptilde$}1.1. The preferred region in Mmin expands by an order of magnitude, and slightly shallower slopes are acceptable if the allowed range of bg is permitted to span all recent observational estimates. We also discuss how the observed clustering of LBGs as a function of luminosity can be used to constrain halo occupation, although because of current observational uncertainties we are unable to reach any strong conclusions. Our methods and results can be used to constrain more realistic models that aim to derive the occupation function N(M) from first principles, and offer insight into how basic physical properties affect the observed properties of LBGs.},

SHAM models based on the peak maximum circular velocity, Vpeak, have had much better success. The primary reason Mpeak based models fail is the relatively low abundance of satellite galaxies produced in these models compared to those based on Vpeak. Despite success in predicting clustering, a simple Vpeak based SHAM model results in predictions for galaxy growth that are at odds with observations. We evaluate three possible remedies that could ``save'' mass-based SHAM: (1) SHAM models require a significant population of ``orphan'' galaxies as a result of artificial disruption/merging of sub-haloes in modern high resolution dark matter simulations; (2) satellites must grow significantly after their accretion; and (3) stellar mass is significantly affected by halo assembly history. No solution is entirely satisfactory. However, regardless of the particulars, we show that popular SHAM models based on Mpeak cannot be complete physical models as presented. Either Vpeak truly is a better predictor of stellar mass at z {$\sim$} 0 and it remains to be seen how the correlation between stellar mass and Vpeak comes about, or SHAM models are missing vital component(s) that significantly affect galaxy clustering.},

We modify the M1 closure relation to stabilize radiation fronts in the optically thin limit. We also introduce anisotropic artificial viscosity and high-order artificial diffusion schemes, which allow the code to handle radiation transport accurately in both the optically thin and optically thick regimes. Non-equilibrium thermo-chemistry is solved using a semiimplicit sub-cycling technique. The computational cost of our method is independent of the number of sources and can be lowered further by using the reduced speed of light approximation. We demonstrate the robustness of our method by applying it to a set of standard tests from the cosmological radiative transfer comparison project of Iliev et al.

  abstract = {Subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) is a widely-used method to connect galaxies with dark matter structures in numerical simulations. SHAM predictions agree remarkably well with observations, yet they still lack strong theoretical support. We examine the performance, implementation, and assumptions of SHAM using the EAGLE project simulations. We find that \$V\_\{\textbackslash rm relax\}\$, the highest value of the circular velocity attained by a subhalo while it satisfies a relaxation criterion, is the subhalo property that correlates most strongly with galaxy stellar mass (\$M\_\{\textbackslash rm star\}\$). Using this parameter in SHAM, we retrieve the real-space clustering of EAGLE to within our statistical uncertainties on scales greater than \$2\$ Mpc for galaxies with \$8.77{$<\backslash$}log\_\{10\}(M\_\{\textbackslash rm star\}[M\_\textbackslash odot]){$<$}10.77\$. Conversely, clustering is overestimated by \$30\textbackslash\%\$ on scales below \$2\$ Mpc for galaxies with \$8.77{$<\backslash$}log\_\{10\}(M\_\{\textbackslash rm star\}[M\_\textbackslash odot]){$<$}9.77\$ because SHAM slightly overpredicts the fraction of satellites in massive haloes compared to EAGLE. The agreement is even better in redshift-space, where the clustering is recovered to within our statistical uncertainties for all masses and separations. Additionally, we analyse the dependence of galaxy clustering on properties other than halo mass, i.e. the assembly bias. We demonstrate assembly bias alters the clustering in EAGLE by \$20\textbackslash\%\$ and that \$V\_\{\textbackslash rm relax\}\$ captures its effect to within \$15\textbackslash\%\$. We trace small differences in the clustering to the failure of SHAM as typically implemented, i.e. the \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm star\}\$ assigned to a subhalo does not depend on i) its host halo mass, ii) whether it is a central or a satellite. In EAGLE we find that these assumptions are not completely satisfied.},

The study includes a spectral energy distribution of a zero-metallicity stellar population, and two initial mass functions (IMFs; Salpeter/Larson). The expansion of the ionization front (I-front) is followed as it breaks out from the galaxy and is channelled by the filaments into the voids, assuming (in a 2D representation) a characteristic butterfly shape. The ionization evolution is very well tracked by our scheme, as realized by the correct treatment of the channelling and shadowing effects resulting from overdensities. We confirm previous claims that both the shape of the IMF and the ionizing power metallicity dependence are important to correctly determine the reionization of the Universe.},

We use a simple, nonparametric model, which monotonically relates galaxy luminosities to the maximum circular velocity of dark matter halos (Vmax) by preserving the observed galaxy luminosity function in order to match the halos in simulations with observed galaxies. The novel feature of the model is the use of the maximum circular velocity at the time of accretion, Vaccmax, for subhalos, the halos located within virial regions of larger halos. We argue that for subhalos in dissipationless simulations, Vaccmax reflects the luminosity and stellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity at the epoch of observation, Vnowmax. The simulations and our model L-Vmax relation predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of the two-point correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxy clustering in the SDSS data at z\textasciitilde 0 and in the DEEP2 samples at z\textasciitilde 1 over the entire probed range of projected separations, 0.1p/(h-1 Mpc){$<$}10.0. In particular, the small-scale upturn of the correlation function from the power-law form in the SDSS and DEEP2 luminosity-selected samples is reproduced very well. At z\textasciitilde 3-5, our predictions also match the observed shape and amplitude of the angular two-point correlation function of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) on both large and small scales, including the small-scale upturn. This suggests that, like galaxies in lower redshift samples, the LBGs are fair tracers of the overall halo population and that their luminosity is tightly correlated with the circular velocity (and hence mass) of their dark matter halos.},

Our goals are (1) to investigate the ability of AGN radiation pressure on dust to launch galactic outflows and (2) to constrain the efficiency of infrared (IR) multiscattering in boosting outflow acceleration. Our simulations are performed with the radiation-hydrodynamic code ramses-RT and include both single- and multiscattered radiation pressure from an AGN, radiative cooling and self-gravity. Since outflowing shells always eventually become transparent to the incident radiation field, outflows that sweep up all intervening gas are likely to remain gravitationally bound to their halo even at high AGN luminosities. The expansion of outflowing shells is well described by simple analytic models as long as the shells are mildly optically thick to IR radiation. In this case, an enhancement in the acceleration of shells through IR multiscattering occurs as predicted, i.e. a force \$\textbackslash dot\{P\} \textbackslash approx \textbackslash tau \_\{\textbackslash rm IR\} L/c\$ is exerted on the gas. For high optical depths {$\tau$}IR {$\greaterequivlnt$} 50, however, momentum transfer between outflowing optically thick gas and IR radiation is rapidly suppressed, even if the radiation is efficiently confined. At high {$\tau$}IR, the characteristic flow time becomes shorter than the required trapping time of IR radiation such that the momentum flux \$\textbackslash dot\{P\} \textbackslash ll \textbackslash tau \_\{\textbackslash rm IR\} L/c\$. We argue that while unlikely to unbind massive galactic gaseous haloes, AGN radiation pressure on dust could play an important role in regulating star formation and black hole accretion in the nuclei of massive compact galaxies at high redshift.},

Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

The increase in the number NH of neighbours when switching to more extended smoothing kernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate definition for the SPH resolution scale) is insufficient to combat these errors. Consequently, trading resolution for better convergence is necessary, but for traditional smoothing kernels this option is limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability. Therefore, we investigate the suitability of the Wendland functions as smoothing kernels and compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear stability analysis in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that the Wendland kernels avoid the pairing instability for all NH, despite having vanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas about the origin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation with the kernel Fourier transform and give an explanation in terms of the SPH density estimator). The Wendland kernels are computationally more convenient than the higher-order B-splines, allowing large NH and hence better numerical convergence (note that computational costs rise sub-linear with NH). Our analysis also shows that at low NH the quartic spline kernel with NH \textasciitilde = 60 obtains much better convergence then the standard cubic spline.},

The reorientation of the spin of massive galaxies is provided by galaxy mergers, which are significant in their mass build-up. We find that the stellar mass transition from alignment to misalignment happens around 3 \texttimes{} 1010 M{$\odot$}. Galaxies form in the vorticity-rich neighbourhood of filaments, and migrate towards the nodes of the cosmic web as they convert their orbital angular momentum into spin. The signature of this process can be traced to the properties of galaxies, as measured relative to the cosmic web. We argue that a strong source of feedback such as active galactic nuclei is mandatory to quench in situ star formation in massive galaxies and promote various morphologies. It allows mergers to play their key role by reducing post-merger gas inflows and, therefore, keeping spins misaligned with cosmic filaments.},

We estimate dot\{N\}\_\{ion\} for the latest observations of the luminosity and star formation rate density at z {$<$} 10, outlining the range of emissivity histories consistent with our new model. Given the growing observational evidence for a UV colour-magnitude relation in high-redshift galaxies, we find that for any plausible evolution in galaxy properties, red (brighter) galaxies are less efficient at producing ionizing photons than their blue (fainter) counterparts. The assumption of a redshift and luminosity evolution in {$\beta$} leads to two important conclusions. First, the ionizing efficiency of galaxies naturally increases with redshift. Secondly, for a luminosity-dependent ionizing efficiency, we find that galaxies down to a rest-frame magnitude of MUV {$\approx$} -15 alone can potentially produce sufficient numbers of ionizing photons to maintain reionization as early as z {$\sim$} 8 for a clumping factor of C\_\{H II\} {$\leq$} 3.},

Such strong perturbations are inaccurately handled with standard time integration schemes, leading to poor energy conservation, a problem that is commonly overlooked. We show for the first time that, in the absence of radiative cooling, concordance of thermal and kinetic feedback are achieved when using an accurate time integration. In order to preserve the concordance of feedback methods when using a more efficient time integration scheme - as for instance the hierarchical time-step scheme - we implement a modified version of the time-step limiter proposed by Saitoh \& Makino. We apply the limiter to general test cases, and first show that this scheme violates energy conservation up to almost 4 orders of magnitude when energy is injected at random times. To tackle this issue, we find it necessary not only to ensure a fast information propagation, but also to enforce a prompt response of the system to the energy perturbation. The method proposed here to handle strong feedback events enables us to achieve energy conservation at per cent level in all tests, even if all the available energy is injected into only one particle. We argue that concordance of feedback methods can be achieved in numerical simulations only if the time integration scheme preserve a high energy conservation level.},

Having assigned to every particle an estimate of its local density, we associate each particle with the densest of the Nhop particles nearest to it. Repeating this process allows us to trace a path, within the particle set itself, from each particle in the direction of increasing density. The path ends when it reaches a particle that is its own densest neighbor; all particles reaching the same such particle are identified as a group. Combined with an adaptive smoothing kernel for finding the densities, this method is spatially adaptive, coordinate-free, and numerically straightforward. One can proceed to process the output by truncating groups at a particular density contour and combining groups that share a (possibly different) density contour. While the resulting algorithm has several user-chosen parameters, we show that the results are insensitive to most of these, the exception being the outer density cutoff of the groups.},

Focusing on VELOCIraptor catalogues for this work, we demonstrate how searching multiple snapshots spanning a dynamical time significantly reduces the number of stranded halos, those lacking a descendant or a progenitor, critically correcting poorly resolved halos. We present a new merit function that improves the distinction between primary and secondary progenitors, reducing tree pathologies. We find FOF accretion rates and merger rates show similar mass ratio dependence. The model merger rates from Poole et al, (2017) agree with the measured net growth of halos through mergers.},

This dependence is completely absent in (sub)halo finders in common use, which generally search for substructure in configuration space, yet is present in codes that track particles belonging to halos as they fall into other halos, such as HBT+.

  abstract = {We describe a new algorithm for finding substructures within dark matter haloes from Nbody simulations. The algorithm relies upon the fact that dynamically distinct substructures in a halo will have a local velocity distribution that differs significantly from the mean, i.e. smooth background halo. We characterize the large-scale mean field using a coarsely grained cell-based approach, while a kernel-smoothing process is used to determined the local velocity distribution. Comparing the ratio of these two estimates allows us to identify particles that are strongly clustered in velocity space relative to the background and thus resident in a substructure. From this population of outliers, groups are identified using a Friends-of-Friendslike approach. False positives are rejected using Poisson noise arguments. This approach does not require a search of the full phase-space structure of a halo, a non-trivial task, and is thus computationally advantageous. We apply our algorithm to several test cases and show that it identifies not only subhaloes, bound overdensities in phase space, but can recover tidal streams with a high purity. Our method can even find streams which do not appear significantly overdense either physically or in phase space.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new code for computing time-dependent continuum radiative transfer and non-equilibrium ionization states in static density fields with periodic boundaries. Our code solves the moments of the radiative transfer equation, closed by an Eddington tensor computed using a long characteristics (LC) method. We show that traditional short characteristics and the optically thin approximation are inappropriate for computing Eddington factors for the problem of cosmological re-ionization. We evolve the non-equilibrium ionization field via an efficient and accurate (errors {$<$}1 per cent) technique that switches between fully implicit or explicit finite differencing depending on whether the local time-scales are long or short compared to the time-step. We tailor our code for the problem of cosmological re-ionization. In tests, the code conserves photons, accurately treats cosmological effects and reproduces analytic Str\"omgren sphere solutions. Its chief weakness is that the computation time for the LC calculation scales relatively poorly compared to other techniques (tLC \textasciitilde{} N\textasciitilde 1.5cells) however, we mitigate this by only recomputing the Eddington tensor when the radiation field changes substantially. Our technique makes almost no physical approximations, so it provides a way to benchmark faster but more approximate techniques. It can readily be extended to evolve multiple frequencies, though we do not do so here. Finally, we note that our method is generally applicable to any problem involving the transfer of continuum radiation through a periodic volume.},

The codes span the range of numerical techniques and implementations currently in use, including smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid methods with fixed, deformable, or multilevel meshes. The goal of this comparison is to assess the reliability of cosmological gasdynamical simulations of clusters in the simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed to be nonradiative. We compare images of the cluster at different epochs, global properties such as mass, temperature and X-ray luminosity, and radial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. On the whole, the agreement among the various simulations is gratifying, although a number of discrepancies exist. Agreement is best for properties of the dark matter and worst for the total X-ray luminosity. Even in this case, simulations that adequately resolve the core radius of the gas distribution predict total X-ray luminosities that agree to within a factor of 2. Other quantities are reproduced to much higher accuracy. For example, the temperature and gas mass fraction within the virial radius agree to within about 10\%, and the ratio of specific dark matter kinetic to gas thermal energies agree to within about 5\%. Various factors, including differences in the internal timing of the simulations, contribute to the spread in calculated cluster properties. Based on the overall consistency of results, we discuss a number of general properties of the cluster we have modeled.},

Equations are integrated following an implicit-explicit scheme, where radiation-matter interaction terms are integrated implicitly, whereas transport and all of the remaining source terms are solved explicitly by means of the same Godunov-type solvers included in PLUTO. Among these, we introduce a new Harten-van Leer-contact (HLLC) solver for optically thin radiation transport. The code is suitable for multidimensional computations in Cartesian, spherical and cylindrical coordinates, using either a single processor or parallel architectures. Adaptive grid computations are also made possible, by means of the CHOMBO library. The algorithm performance is demonstrated through a series of numerical benchmarks by investigating various different configurations with a particular emphasis on the behavior of the solutions in the free-streaming and diffusion limits.},

The divergence constraint of the latter is maintained to the truncation error by a new meshless divergence cleaning procedure. The physics of the interaction between the particles is described by an one-dimensional Riemann problem in a moving frame. As a result, necessary diffusion which is required to treat dissipative processes is added automatically. As a result, our scheme has no free parameters that controls the physics of inter-particle interaction, with the exception of the number of the interacting neighbours which control the resolution and accuracy. The resulting equations have the form similar to SPH equations, and therefore existing SPH codes can be used to implement the weighed particle scheme. The scheme is validated in several hydrodynamic and MHD test cases. In particular, we demonstrate for the first time the ability of a meshless MHD scheme to model magneto-rotational instability in accretion disks.},

The magnetic field shows ordered large-scale geometry that remains stable for the duration of our numerical experiments extending over 10\% of the disk lifetime. Strong magnetic pressure allows high accretion rate and inhibits disk fragmentation. This in combination with the repeated feeding of magnetized molecular clouds to an SMBH yields a possible solution to the long-standing puzzle of black hole growth in the centers of galaxies.},

We use these techniques to produce a new set of mock catalogs for the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey based on the output of the high-resolution Bolshoi simulation, as well as two other simulations with different cosmological parameters, all of which we release for public use. The mock-catalog creation technique uses subhalo abundance matching to assign galaxy luminosities to simulated dark-matter halos. It then adds color information to the resulting mock galaxies in a manner that depends on the local galaxy density, in order to reproduce the measured color-environment relation in the data. In the course of constructing the catalogs, we test various models for including scatter in the relation between halo mass and galaxy luminosity, within the abundance-matching framework. We find that there is no constant-scatter model that can simultaneously reproduce both the luminosity function and the autocorrelation function of DEEP2. This result has implications for galaxy-formation theory, and it restricts the range of contexts in which the mock catalogs can be usefully applied. Nevertheless, careful comparisons show that our new mock catalogs accurately reproduce a wide range of the other properties of the DEEP2 catalog, suggesting that they can be used to gain a detailed understanding of various selection effects in DEEP2.},

  abstract = {Methods. The radiation transfer is modelled using a two-moment model and a closure relation that allows large angular anisotropies in the radiation field to be preserved and reproduced. The radiative equations thus obtained are solved by a second-order Godunov-type method and integrated implicitly by using iterative solvers. HERACLES has been parallelized with the MPI library and implemented in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. To characterize the accuracy of HERACLES and to compare it with other codes, we performed a series of tests including purely radiative tests and radiation-hydrodynamics ones. Results. The results show that the physical model used in HERACLES for the transfer is fairly accurate in both the diffusion and transport limit, but also for semi-transparent regions. Conclusions. This makes HERACLES very well-suited to studying many astrophysical problems such as radiative shocks, molecular jets of young stars, fragmentation and formation of dense cores in the interstellar medium, and protoplanetary discs.},

  abstract = {Chemistry plays a key role in many astrophysical situations regulating the cooling and the thermal properties of the gas, which are relevant during gravitational collapse, the evolution of discs and the fragmentation process. In order to simplify the usage of chemical networks in large numerical simulations, we present the chemistry package KROME, consisting of a PYTHON pre-processor which generates a subroutine for the solution of chemical networks which can be embedded in any numerical code. For the solution of the rate equations, we make use of the high-order solver DLSODES, which was shown to be both accurate and efficient for sparse networks, which are typical in astrophysical applications. KROME also provides a large set of physical processes connected to chemistry, including photochemistry, cooling, heating, dust treatment and reverse kinetics. The package presented here already contains a network for primordial chemistry, a small metal network appropriate for the modelling of low metallicities environments, a detailed network for the modelling of molecular clouds, a network for planetary atmospheres, as well as a framework for the modelling of the dust grain population. In this paper, we present an extended test suite ranging from one-zone and 1D models to first applications including cosmological simulations with ENZO and RAMSES and 3D collapse simulations with the FLASH code.

TREVR is designed to handle large numbers of sources and absorbers; it is based on a tree data structure and is thus suited to codes that use trees for their gravity or hydrodynamics solvers (e.g. Adaptive Mesh Refinement). It achieves computational speed while maintaining a specified accuracy via controlled lowering of the resolution of both sources and rays from each source. TREVR computes the radiation field in order \$\{N\textbackslash log N\_\{source\}\}\$ time without absorption and order \$\{N \textbackslash log N\_\{source\} \textbackslash log\{N\}\}\$ time with absorption. These scalings arise from merging sources of radiation according to an opening angle criterion and walking the tree structure to trace a ray to a depth that gives the chosen accuracy for absorption. The absorption-depth refinement criterion is unique to TREVR. We provide a suite of tests demonstrating the algorithm's ability to accurately compute fluxes, ionization fronts and shadows.},

We introduce a new Meshless Finite Mass (MFM) implementation in OpenGadget3 and apply it to this specific problem. To this end, we present a set of test cases to validate our implementation of the MFM framework in our code. These include but are not limited to: the soundwave and Kepler disk as smooth situations to probe the stability, a Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as popular mixing instabilities, a blob test as more complex example including both mixing and shocks, shock tubes with various Mach numbers, a Sedov blast wave, different tests including self-gravity such as gravitational freefall, a hydrostatic sphere, the Zeldovich-pancake, and the nifty cluster as cosmological application. Advantages over SPH include increased mixing and a better convergence behavior. We demonstrate that the MFM-solver is robust, also in a cosmological context. We show evidence that the solver preforms extraordinarily well when applied to decaying subsonic turbulence, a problem very difficult to handle for many methods. MFM captures the expected velocity power spectrum with high accuracy and shows a good convergence behavior. Using MFM or SPH within OpenGadget3 leads to a comparable decay in turbulent energy due to numerical dissipation. When studying the energy decay for different initial turbulent energy fractions, we find that MFM performs well down to Mach numbers \$\textbackslash mathcal\{M\}\textbackslash approx 0.007\$. Finally, we show how important the slope limiter and the energy-entropy switch are to control the behavior and the evolution of the fluids.},

  abstract = {We have updated and extended our semi-analytic galaxy formation  modelling capabilities and applied them simultaneously to the stored halo/subhalo merger trees of the Millennium and Millennium-II Simulations (MS and MS-II, respectively). These differ by a factor of 125 in mass resolution, allowing explicit testing of resolution effects on predicted galaxy properties. We have revised the treatment of the transition between the rapid infall and cooling flow regimes of gas accretion, of the sizes of bulges, and of gaseous and stellar discs, of supernova feedback, of the transition between central and satellite status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and star stripping, once they become satellites. Plausible values of efficiency and scaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed abundance of low-redshift galaxies over five orders of magnitude in stellar mass and 9 mag in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance of Milky Way satellites. This suggests that reionization effects may not be needed to solve the 'missing-satellite' problem, except, perhaps, for the faintest objects. The same model matches the observed large-scale clustering of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and colour. The fit remains excellent down to \texttildelow 30 kpc for massive galaxies. For M* {$<$} 6 \texttimes{} 1010 M{$\odot$}, however, the model overpredicts clustering at scales below \texttildelow 1 Mpc, suggesting that the assumed fluctuation amplitude, {$\sigma$}8= 0.9, is too high. The observed difference in clustering between active and passive galaxies is matched quite well for all masses. Galaxy distributions within rich clusters agree between the simulations and match those observed, but only if galaxies without dark matter subhaloes (so-called orphans) are included. Even at MS-II resolution, schemes which assign galaxies only to resolved dark matter subhaloes cannot match observed clusters. Our model predicts a larger passive fraction among low-mass galaxies than is observed, as well as an overabundance of \texttildelow 1010 M{$\odot$} galaxies beyond z\texttildelow{} 0.6. (The abundance of \texttildelow 1011 M{$\odot$} galaxies is matched out to z\texttildelow{} 3.) These discrepancies appear to reflect deficiencies in the way star formation rates are modelled.},

We find: (i) at z = 0, there is an almost perfect alignment at a median angle of 18\textdegree, in the inner dark matter halo regions where the discs reside, between the spin vector of the gaseous and stellar galactic discs and that of their inner host haloes. The alignment between galaxy spin and spin of the entire host halo is however significantly weaker, ranging from a median of \textasciitilde{} 46\textdegree{} at z = 1 to \textasciitilde{} 50\textdegree{} at z = 0. (ii) The most massive galaxy discs have spins preferentially aligned so as to point along their host filaments. (iii) The spin of discs in lower mass haloes shows, at redshifts above z \textasciitilde{} 0.5 and in regions of low environmental density, a clear signature of alignment with the intermediate principal axis of the large-scale tidal field. This behaviour is consistent with predictions of linear tidal torque theory. This alignment decreases with increasing environmental density, and vanishes in the highest density regions. Non-linear effects in the high-density environments are plausibly responsible for establishing this density-alignment correlation. We expect that our numerical results provide important insights for both understanding intrinsic alignment in weak lensing from the astrophysical perspective and formation and evolution processes of galactic discs in a cosmological context.},

  abstract = {We discuss a new algorithm to generate multi-scale initial conditions with multiple levels of refinements for cosmological "zoom-in" simulations. The method uses an adaptive convolution of Gaussian white noise with a real space transfer function kernel together with an adaptive multi-grid Poisson solver to generate displacements and velocities following first (1LPT) or second order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). The new algorithm achieves RMS relative errors of order 10\^(-4) for displacements and velocities in the refinement region and thus improves in terms of errors by about two orders of magnitude over previous approaches. In addition, errors are localized at coarse-fine boundaries and do not suffer from Fourier-space induced interference ringing. An optional hybrid multi-grid and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based scheme is introduced which has identical Fourier space behaviour as traditional approaches. Using a suite of re-simulations of a galaxy cluster halo our real space based approach is found to reproduce correlation functions, density profiles, key halo properties and subhalo abundances with per cent level accuracy. Finally, we generalize our approach for two-component baryon and dark-matter simulations and demonstrate that the power spectrum evolution is in excellent agreement with linear perturbation theory. For initial baryon density fields, it is suggested to use the local Lagrangian approximation in order to generate a density field for mesh based codes that is consistent with Lagrangian perturbation theory instead of the current practice of using the Eulerian linearly scaled densities.},

More significantly, the improvement in efficiency is achieved without the introduction of a grid. A unification of SPH with the hierarchical tree method is a natural way of allowing for larger N within a Lagrangian framework.

  abstract = {Various formulations of smooth-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) have been proposed, intended to resolve certain difficulties in the treatment of fluid mixing instabilities. Most have involved changes to the algorithm which either introduce artificial correction terms or violate what is arguably the greatest advantage of SPH over other methods: manifest conservation of energy, entropy, momentum, and angular momentum. Here, we show how a class of alternative SPH equations of motion (EOM) can be derived self-consistently from a discrete particle Lagrangian \textendash{} guaranteeing manifest conservation \textendash{} in a manner which tremendously improves treatment of these instabilities and contact discontinuities. Saitoh \& Makino recently noted that the volume element used to discretize the EOM does not need to explicitly invoke the mass density (as in the ``standard'' approach); we show how this insight, and the resulting degree of freedom, can be incorporated into the rigorous Lagrangian formulation that retains ideal conservation properties and includes the ``{$\nabla$}h'' terms that account for variable smoothing lengths. We derive a general EOM for any choice of volume element (particle ``weights'') and method of determining smoothing lengths. We then specify this to a ``pressure-entropy formulation'' which resolves problems in the traditional treatment of fluid interfaces. Implementing this in a new version of the GADGET code, we show it leads to good performance in mixing experiments (e.g. Kelvin-Helmholtz \& ``blob'' tests). And conservation is maintained even in strong shock/blastwave tests, where formulations without manifest conservation produce large errors. This also improves the treatment of sub-sonic turbulence, and lessens the need for large kernel particle numbers. The code changes are trivial and entail no additional numerical expense. This provides a general framework for self-consistent derivation of different ``flavors'' of SPH.},

The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume 'overlap.' We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity \& cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO: this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require 'artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages vs. SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced 'particle noise' \& numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, \& sharp shock-capturing. Advantages vs. non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors \& numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of 'grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous disks, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize 'grid noise.'

  abstract = {Radiation pressure (RP; or photon momentum absorbed by gas) is important in a tremendous range of astrophysical systems. But we show the usual method for assigning absorbed photon momentum to gas in numerical radiationhydrodynamics simulations (integrating over cell volumes or evaluating at cell centers) can severely under-estimate the RP force in the immediate vicinity around un-resolved (point/discrete) sources (and subsequently under-estimate its effects on bulk gas properties), unless photon mean-free-paths are highly-resolved in the fluid grid. The existence of this error is independent of the numerical radiation transfer (RT) method (even in exact ray-tracing/Monte-Carlo methods), because it depends on how the RT solution is interpolated back onto fluid elements. Brute-force convergence (resolving mean-free paths) is impossible in many cases (especially where UV/ionizing photons are involved). Instead, we show a ``face-integrated'' method \textendash{} integrating and applying the momentum fluxes at interfaces between fluid elements \textendash{} better approximates the correct solution at all resolution levels. The ``fix'' is simple and we provide example implementations for ray-tracing, Monte-Carlo, and moments RT methods in both grid and mesh-free fluid schemes. We consider an example of star formation in a molecular cloud with UV/ionizing RP. At state-of-the-art resolution, cell-integrated methods underestimate the net effects of RP by an order of magnitude, leading (incorrectly) to the conclusion that RP is unimportant, while face-integrated methods predict strong self-regulation of star formation and cloud destruction via RP.},

  abstract = {Radiative transfer simulations are now at the forefront of numerical astrophysics. They are becoming crucial for an increasing number of astrophysical and cosmological problems; at the same time their computational cost has come to the reach of currently available computational power. Further progress is retarded by the considerable number of different algorithms (including various flavours of ray-tracing and moment schemes) developed, which makes the selection of the most suitable technique for a given problem a non-trivial task. Assessing the validity ranges, accuracy and performances of these schemes is the main aim of this paper, for which we have compared 11 independent RT codes on 5 test problems: (0) basic physics, (1) isothermal H II region expansion and (2) H II region expansion with evolving temperature, (3) I-front trapping and shadowing by a dense clump, (4) multiple sources in a cosmological density field. The outputs of these tests have been compared and differences analyzed. The agreement between the various codes is satisfactory although not perfect. The main source of discrepancy appears to reside in the multi-frequency treatment approach, resulting in different thicknesses of the ionized-neutral transition regions and different temperature structure. The present results and tests represent the most complete benchmark available for the development of new codes and improvement of existing ones. To this aim all test inputs and outputs are made publicly available in digital form.},

  abstract = {The development of radiation hydrodynamical methods that are able to follow gas dynamics and radiative transfer self-consistently is key to the solution of many problems in numerical astrophysics. Such fluid flows are highly complex, rarely allowing even for approximate analytical solutions against which numerical codes can be tested. An alternative validation procedure is to compare different methods against each other on common problems, in order to assess the robustness of the results and establish a range of validity for the methods. Previously, we presented such a comparison for a set of pure radiative transfer tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving density fields). This is the second paper of the Cosmological Radiative Transfer (RT) Comparison Project, in which we compare 9 independent RT codes directly coupled to gasdynamics on 3 relatively simple astrophysical hydrodynamics problems: (5) the expansion of an H II region in a uniform medium; (6) an ionization front (I-front) in a 1/r2 density profile with a flat core, and (7), the photoevaporation of a uniform dense clump. Results show a broad agreement between the different methods and no big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certain level of maturity and reliability. However, many details still do differ, and virtually every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in one respect or another, with the majority of the results. This underscores the fact that no method is universal and all require careful testing of the particular features which are most relevant to the specific problem at hand.},

First, we derive the distribution function of intergalactic absorbers from the latest observational statistics of the Ly{$\alpha$} forest, Lyman-limit systems and damped Ly{$\alpha$} systems. The distribution function reproduces the observed redshift evolution of the Ly{$\alpha$} depression and the mean-free path of the Lyman continuum excellently and simultaneously. We then derive a set of analytic functions describing the mean intergalactic attenuation curve for objects at z {$>$} 0.5. The new model predicts less (or more) Ly{$\alpha$} attenuation for z {$\simeq$} 3-5 (z {$>$} 6) sources through the usual broad-band filters relative to the original Madau model. This may cause a systematic difference in the photometric redshift estimates, which is, however, still small: about 0.05. Finally, we find a more than 0.5 mag overestimation of Lyman-continuum attenuation in the original Madau model at z {$>$} 3, which causes a significant overcorrection against direct observations of the Lyman continuum of galaxies.},

Unusually for CEE-related work, we mostly try to avoid relying on results from population synthesis or observations, in order to avoid potentially being misled by previous misunderstandings. As far as possible we debate all the relevant issues starting from physics alone, all the way from the evolution of the binary system immediately before CEE begins to the processes which might occur just after the ejection of the envelope. In particular, we include extensive discussion about the energy sources and sinks operating in CEE, and hence examine the foundations of the standard energy formalism. Special attention is also given to comparing the results of hydrodynamic simulations from different groups and to discussing the potential effect of initial conditions on the differences in the outcomes. We compare current numerical techniques for the problem of CEE and also whether more appropriate tools could and should be produced (including new formulations of computational hydrodynamics, and attempts to include 3D processes within 1D codes). Finally we explore new ways to link CEE with observations. We compare previous simulations of CEE to the recent outburst from V1309 Sco, and discuss to what extent post-common-envelope binaries and nebulae can provide information, e.g. from binary eccentricities, which is not currently being fully exploited.},

The algorithm is fully parallel and based on the Message Passing Interface. As opposed to most available merger tree tools, it works on the fly during the course of the N-body simulation. It can track dark matter substructures individually using the index of the most bound particle in the clump. Once a halo (or a sub-halo) merges into another one, the algorithm still tracks it through the last identified most bound particle in the clump, allowing to check at later snapshots whether the merging event was definitive, or whether it was only temporary, with the clump only traversing another one. The same technique can be used to track orphan galaxies that are not assigned to a parent clump anymore because the clump dissolved due to numerical overmerging. We study in detail the impact of various parameters on the resulting halo catalogues and corresponding merger histories. We then compare the performance of our method using standard validation diagnostics, demonstrating that we reach a quality similar to the best available and commonly used merger tree tools. As a proof of concept, we use our merger tree algorithm together with a parametrized stellar-mass-to-halo-mass relation and generate a mock galaxy catalogue that shows good agreement with observational data.},

Radiated photons are transferred from the sources through the series of Voronoi gas cells within a specific solid angle. From the photon attenuation, we derive corresponding photon fluxes and ionization rates and feed them to a primordial chemistry module. This gives us a self-consistent method for studying dynamical and chemical processes caused by ionizing sources in primordial gas. Since the computational cost of the SIMPLEX method does not scale directly with the number of sources, it is convenient for studying systems such as primordial star-forming haloes that may form multiple ionizing sources.},

It has several advantages compared to other approaches: its computational cost is independent of the number of radiation sources (unlike typical ray-tracing methods) and it is less diffusive than moment-based methods. Version 1 of sprai has already been shown to do an excellent job of modelling the growth of R-type ionization fronts in low-density gas. However, it does not perform so well with D-type fronts in denser gas unless run with a small time-step. Version 2 of the code addresses this weakness in the algorithm, allowing us to dramatically improve its performance in dense gas. Version 2 of sprai also includes two important updates to the microphysics treated in the code: a revised multifrequency framework that allows us to model helium photoionization, and a treatment of the effects of radiation pressure. In this paper, we describe these enhancements to sprai and also present several tests of the code.},

One advantage of these `Dhaloes' over the commonly used friends-of-friends (FoF) haloes is that they retain their individual identity in the cases when FoF haloes are artificially merged by tenuous bridges of particles or by an overlap of their outer diffuse haloes. Dhaloes are thus well suited for modelling galaxy formation and their merger trees form the basis of the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model, GALFORM. Applying the Dhalo construction to the {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter Millennium II Simulation, we find that approximately 90 per cent of Dhaloes have a one-to-one, bijective match with a corresponding FoF halo. The remaining 10 per cent are typically secondary components of large FoF haloes. Although the mass functions of both types of haloes are similar, the mass of Dhaloes correlates much more tightly with the virial mass, M200, than FoF haloes. Approximately 80 per cent of FoF and bijective and non-bijective Dhaloes are relaxed according to standard criteria. For these relaxed haloes, all three types have similar concentration-M200 relations and, at fixed mass, the concentration distributions are described accurately by log-normal distributions.},

However, using a semi-analytic model, we found that on average the growth rate of the stellar mass of central galaxies is largely insensitive to large-scale environment. Although our results show that the star formation rate (SFR) and the stellar mass of central galaxies in smaller halos are slightly affected by the assembly bias of halos, those galaxies are faint and the difference in the SFR is minute, therefore it is challenging to detect it in real galaxies given the current observational accuracy. Future galaxy surveys, such as the BigBOSS experiment and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which are expected to provide observational data for fainter objects, will provide a chance to test our model predictions.},

Unlike many earlier investigations based on semi-analytical models, we make use of the subhalos resolved in the \$N\$-body simulations to follow the mergers of galaxies in dark halos, and we show that this is pivotal in modeling correctly the galaxy luminosity function at the bright end and the bimodal nature of galaxy color distribution. Mergers of galaxies based on subhalos also result in many more bright red galaxies at high \$z\$. The semi-analytical model we adopt is similar to those used in earlier semi-analytical studies, except that we consider the effect of a prolonged cooling in small halos and that we explicitly follow the chemical enrichment in the interstellar medium. We use our model to make predictions for the properties of the galaxy population at low redshift and compare them with various current observations. We find that our model predictions can match the luminosity functions of galaxies in various wavebands redder than the u-band. The shape of the luminosity function at bright end is well reproduced if galaxy mergers are modeled with the merger trees of subhalos and the steep faint-end slope can be moderated if the gas cooling time in low-mass halos is comparable to the age of the universe. The model with subhalos resolved can reproduce the main features in the observed color bimodal distribution, though it still predicts too many bright blue galaxies. The same model can also match the color-magnitude relation for elliptical galaxies in clusters, the metallicity-luminosity relation.},

A Harten-Lax-Van Leer flux function, suitably modified for moving meshes, is then used to solve the Riemann problem at the interface. The implementation is fully conservative and compatible with the individual timestepping scheme of AREPO. It incorporates atomic Hydrogen (H) and Helium (He) thermochemistry, which is used to couple the ultra-violet (UV) radiation field to the gas. Additionally, infrared radiation is coupled to the gas under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium between the gas and the dust. We successfully apply our code to a large number of test problems, including applications such as the expansion of \$\{\textbackslash rm H\_\{II\}\}\$ regions, radiation pressure driven outflows and the levitation of optically thick layer of gas by trapped IR radiation. The new implementation is suitable for studying various important astrophysical phenomena, such as the effect of radiative feedback in driving galactic scale outflows, radiation driven dusty winds in high redshift quasars, or simulating the reionisation history of the Universe in a self consistent manner.},

From the early work it was clear that multilevel techniques held great promise; however, it was not knownif they can be made to consistently produce high quality partitions for graphs arising in a wide range of application domains. We investigate the effectiveness of many different choices for all three phases: coarsening, partition of the coarsest graph, and refinement. In particular, we present a new coarsening heuristic (called heavy-edge heuristic) for which the size of the partition of the coarse graph is within a small factor of the size of the final partition obtained after multilevel refinement. We also present a much faster variation of the Kernighan--Lin (KL) algorithm for refining during uncoarsening. We test our scheme on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that our scheme produces partitions that are consistently better than those produced by spectral partitioning schemes in substantially smaller time. Also, when our scheme is used to compute fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrices, it produces orderings that have substantially smaller fill than the widely used multiple minimum degree algorithm.},

  abstract = {We describe numerical methods for incorporating gasdynamics into cosmological simulations and present illustrative applications to the cold dark matter (CDM) scenario. Our evolution code, a version of TreeSPH (Hernquist \& Katz 1989) generalized to handle comoving coordinates and periodic boundary conditions, combines smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with the hierarchical tree method for computing gravitational forces. The Lagrangian hydrodynamics approach and individual time steps for gas particles give the algorithm a large dynamic range, which is essential for studies of galaxy formation in a cosmological context. The code incorporates radiative cooling for an optically thin, primordial composition gas in ionization equilibrium with a user-specified ultraviolet background. We adopt a phenomenological prescription for star formation that gradually turns cold, dense, Jeans-unstable gas into collisionless stars, returning supernova feedback energy to the surrounding medium. In CDM simulations, some of the baryons that fall into dark matter potential wells dissipate their acquired thermal energy and condense into clumps with roughly galactic masses. The resulting galaxy population is insensitive to assumptions about star formation; we obtain similar baryonic mass functions and galaxy correlation functions from simulations with star formation and from simulations without star formation in which we identify galaxies directly from the cold, dense gas.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy formation during the epoch of reionization in an effort towards modelling the interstellar medium (ISM) and interpreting Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Simulations with and without stellar radiation are compared at large (Mpc), intermediate (tens of kpc) and small (sub-kpc) scales. At large scales, the dense regions around galaxies reionize first before ultraviolet (UV) photons penetrate the voids; however, considerable amounts of neutral gas remain present within the haloes. The spatial distribution of neutral gas is highly dynamic and is anticorrelated with the presence of stars older than a few Myr. For our specific feedback implementation, most of the metals remain inside the virial radii of haloes, and they are proportionally distributed over the ionized and neutral media by mass. For our most massive galaxy with Mh {$\sim$} 1011 M{$\odot$}, the majority of the C II and O I masses are associated with cold neutral clumps. N II is more diffuse and arises in warmer gas, while O III arises in hotter gas with a higher ionization parameter, produced by photoheating and supernovae. If smaller pockets of high-metallicity gas exist in the ISM, the emission from these ions may be observable by ALMA, while the low metallicity of the galaxy may cause these systems to fall below the local [C II]-star formation rate relation. The presence of dust can cause spatial offsets between UV/Lyman {$\alpha$} and [C II] emissions, as suggested by the recent observations of Maiolino et al. [O III] may be spatially offset from both of these components since it arises from a different part of density-temperature phase space.},

  abstract = {Emission and absorption lines from elements heavier than helium (metals) represent one of our strongest probes of galaxy formation physics across nearly all redshifts accessible to observations. The vast majority of simulations that model these metal lines often assume either collisional or photoionisation equilibrium, or a combination of the two. For the few simulations that have relaxed these assumptions, a redshift-dependent meta-galactic UV background or fixed spectrum is often used in the non-equilibrium photoionisation calculation, which is unlikely to be accurate in the interstellar medium where the gas can self-shield as well as in the high-redshift circumgalactic medium where locally emitted radiation may dominate over the UV background. In this work, we relax this final assumption by coupling the ionisation states of individual metals to the radiation hydrodynamics solver present in RAMSES-RT. Our chemical network follows radiative recombination, dielectronic recombination, collisional ionisation, photoionisation, and charge transfer and we use the ionisation states to compute non-equilibrium optically-thin metal-line cooling. The fiducial model solves for the ionisation states of C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Fe, and Ne in addition to H, He, and H\$\_2\$, but can be easily extended for other ions. We provide interfaces to two different ODE solvers that are competitive in both speed and accuracy. The code has been benchmarked across a variety of gas conditions to reproduce results from CLOUDY when equilibrium is reached. We show an example isolated galaxy simulation with on-the-fly radiative transfer that demonstrates the utility of our code for translating between simulations and observations without the use of idealised photoionisation models.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new technique for following the formation and evolution  of galaxies in cosmological N-body simulations. Dissipationless simulations are used to track the formation and merging of dark matter haloes as a function of redshift. Simple prescriptions, taken directly from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation, are adopted for gas cooling, star formation, supernova feedback and the merging of galaxies within the haloes. This scheme enables us to explore the clustering properties of galaxies, and to investigate how selection by luminosity, colour or type influences the results. In this paper we study the properties of the galaxy distribution at z=0. These include B- and K-band luminosity functions, two-point correlation functions, pairwise peculiar velocities, cluster mass-to-light ratios, B-V colours, and star formation rates. We focus on two variants of a cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology: a high-density (Omega =1) model with shape-parameter Gamma =0.21 (tau CDM), and a low-density model with Omega =0.3 and Lambda =0.7 (Lambda CDM). Both models are normalized to reproduce the I-band Tully-Fisher relation of Giovanelli et al. near a circular velocity of 220 km s\^-1. Our results depend strongly both on this normalization and on the adopted prescriptions for star formation and feedback. Very different assumptions are required to obtain an acceptable model in the two cases. For tau CDM, efficient feedback is required to suppress the growth of galaxies, particularly in low-mass field haloes. Without it, there are too many galaxies and the correlation function exhibits a strong turnover on scales below 1 Mpc. For Lambda CDM, feedback must be weaker, otherwise too few L\_* galaxies are produced and the correlation function is too steep. Although neither model is perfect, both come close to reproducing most of the data. Given the uncertainties in modelling some of the critical physical processes, we conclude that it is not yet possible to draw firm conclusions about the values of cosmological parameters from studies of this kind. Further observational work on global star formation and feedback effects is required to narrow the range of possibilities.},

  abstract = {In hierarchical cosmologies the evolution of galaxy clustering depends  both on cosmological quantities such as Omega, Lambda and P(k), which determine how collapsed structures - dark matter haloes - form and evolve, and on the physical processes - cooling, star formation, radiative and hydrodynamic feedback - which drive the formation of galaxies within these merging haloes. In this paper we combine dissipationless cosmological N-body simulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in order to study how these two aspects interact. We focus on the differences in clustering predicted for galaxies of differing luminosity, colour, morphology and star formation rate, and on what these differences can teach us about the galaxy formation process. We show that a `dip' in the amplitude of galaxy correlations between z=0 and z=1 can be an important diagnostic. Such a dip occurs in low-density CDM models, because structure forms early, and dark matter haloes of mass \textasciitilde 10\^12M\_solar, containing galaxies with luminosities \textasciitilde L\_*, are unbiased tracers of the dark matter over this redshift range; their clustering amplitude then evolves similarly to that of the dark matter. At higher redshifts, bright galaxies become strongly biased and the clustering amplitude increases again. In high density models, structure forms late, and bias evolves much more rapidly. As a result, the clustering amplitude of L\_* galaxies remains constant from z=0 to z=1. The strength of these effects is sensitive to sample selection. The dip becomes weaker for galaxies with lower star formation rates, redder colours, higher luminosities and earlier morphological types. We explain why this is the case, and how it is related to the variation with redshift of the abundance and environment of the observed galaxies. We also show that the relative peculiar velocities of galaxies are biased low in our models, but that this effect is never very strong. Studies of clustering evolution as a function of galaxy properties should place strong constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {We construct semi-analytic models for galaxy formation within the framework of a hierarchical clustering scenario for structure formation in the Universe. We use the algorithm of Kauffmann \& White to generate ensembles of merging histories for present-day dark matter haloes with a wide range of circular velocities. A galaxy is assumed to form from gas which cools and turns into stars at the centre of a halo until that halo merges with a more massive object. At this time the galaxy loses its source of new gas and becomes a non-dominant object within a larger group or cluster. Our methods thus enable us to `look inside' present dark matter haloes and investigate the formation, evolution and merging of the galaxies that they contain. We begin by investigating the properties of haloes with V\_c\_ = 220 km s\^-1\^, and use the observed properties of our Milky Way system to tune the free parameters that regulate star formation, hydrodynamic feedback from supernovae and the transformation of discs into spheroids by mergers. We then show that the same parameters lead to good agreement between the properties of galaxies in a V\_c\_ = 1000 km s\^-1\^ halo and observational data on the Virgo cluster of galaxies. This model correctly reproduces the observed trends in the luminosity, colour, gas content and morphology of galaxies. Turning to an investigation of the properties of the galaxy population as a whole, we highlight a problem that arises when applying this model to a `standard' cold dark matter universe. If the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation is set by the properties of our Milky Way system, we find that standard CDM predicts too many haloes and results in a B-band luminosity density of the Universe that is a factor of 2 too high. The only apparent solution to this problem is to assume that many haloes remain observationally undetectable. We also compute the gas mass-luminosity relation for galaxies, the variation in galaxy morphology as a function of luminosity, star formation histories according to environment, the field galaxy luminosity function, and predictions for faint galaxy counts in the B and K bands. We conclude that, although it would be premature to attempt a detailed quantitative fit to specific cosmological models, the qualitative agreement between the data and the general picture that we present is already very encouraging.},

We utilize the infrastructure we have built for the AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project. This includes the common disk initial conditions, common physics models (e.g., radiative cooling and UV background by the standardized package Grackle) and common analysis toolkit yt, all of which are publicly available. Subgrid physics models such as Jeans pressure floor, star formation, supernova feedback energy, and metal production are carefully constrained across code platforms. With numerical accuracy that resolves the disk scale height, we find that the codes overall agree well with one another in many dimensions including: gas and stellar surface densities, rotation curves, velocity dispersions, density and temperature distribution functions, disk vertical heights, stellar clumps, star formation rates, and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations. Quantities such as velocity dispersions are very robust (agreement within a few tens of percent at all radii) while measures like newly formed stellar clump mass functions show more significant variation (difference by up to a factor of {$\sim$}3). Systematic differences exist, for example, between mesh-based and particle-based codes in the low-density region, and between more diffusive and less diffusive schemes in the high-density tail of the density distribution. Yet intrinsic code differences are generally small compared to the variations in numerical implementations of the common subgrid physics such as supernova feedback. Our experiment reassures that, if adequately designed in accordance with our proposed common parameters, results of a modern high-resolution galaxy formation simulation are more sensitive to input physics than to intrinsic differences in numerical schemes.},

We validate our implementation through several standard test problems, including the propagation of radiation in vacuum and the expansions of various types of H II regions. Additionally, scaling tests show that the cost of a full ray trace per source remains comparable to that of the hydrodynamics update on up to {$\sim$} \{10\}3 processors. To demonstrate application of our ART implementation, we perform a simulation of star cluster formation in a marginally bound, turbulent cloud, finding that its star formation efficiency is 12\% when both radiation pressure forces and photoionization by UV radiation are treated. We directly compare the radiation forces computed from the ART scheme with those from the M1 closure relation. Although the ART and M1 schemes yield similar results on large scales, the latter is unable to resolve the radiation field accurately near individual point sources.},

These codes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends, spherical-overdensity and phase-space-based algorithms. We further introduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allow halo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against those presented here. This set includes mock haloes containing various levels and distributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as a cosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. All the halo-finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location of our mock haloes. They further returned lists of particles (potentially) belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of the circular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. All the finders based in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was located close to the centre of the host halo, and the radial dependence of the mass recovered varies from finder to finder. Those finders based in phase space could resolve central substructure although they found difficulties in accurately recovering its properties. Through a resolution study we found that most of the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than 30-40 particles. However, also here the phase-space finders excelled by resolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. By comparing the halo finders using a high-resolution cosmological volume, we found that they agree remarkably well on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass, position, velocity and peak of the rotation curve). We further suggest to utilize the peak of the rotation curve, vmax, as a proxy for mass, given the arbitrariness in defining a proper halo edge. Airport code for Madrid, Spain},

By combining WMAP with the latest distance measurements from BAO and H0 measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest LCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is n\_s=0.968+-0.012, a measurement that excludes the scale-invariant spectrum by 99.5\%CL. The other parameters are also improved from the 5-year results. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, sum(m\_nu){$<$}0.58eV, and the effective number of neutrino species, N\_eff=4.34+0.86-0.88. We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis. We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z=1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. With the 7-year TB power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved to Delta(alpha)=-1.1+-1.4(stat)+-1.5(syst) degrees. We report significant detections of the SZ effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data. However, it is a factor of 0.5 to 0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically-expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope collaboration.},

The simulations are used to study the properties and possible observational signatures of intergalactic medium in the LSC region. We find that in agreement with previous unconstrained simulations, \textasciitilde 30\% of the gas in this region is in the warm/hot phase at T\textasciitilde 105-107 K and \textasciitilde 40\% in the diffuse phase at T{$<$}105 K in low-density regions. The X-ray emission from the warm/hot gas may represent a small (\textasciitilde 5\%-10\%) but important contribution to the X-ray background observed by the ROSAT All-Sky Survey at energies around 1 keV. The best prospects for detection of the warm/hot intergalactic medium of the LSC located in filaments and in the vicinity of virialized regions of groups and clusters are through absorption in resonant lines of O VII and O VIII in soft X-rays and in the O VI doublet in UV. If intergalactic gas in filaments ({$\rho$}/{$<\rho>\sptilde$}1-10) is enriched to typical metallicities of {$>\sptilde$}0.05, the column densities of O VI, O VII, and O VIII along a random line of sight near the north Galactic pole, especially near the supergalactic plane, have a significant probability to be in the range detectable by current (FUSE, XMM) and future (Constellation-X) instruments.},

  abstract = {We analyze the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and two-point correlation function of galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the ``subhalos,'' distinct gravitationally bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the HOD, the probability distribution for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N, is similar to that found in semianalytic and N-body+gasdynamics studies. Its first moment, M, has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power-law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for M{$<\sptilde$}4. We show that the HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number Ns of satellite galaxies. The former can be approximated by a steplike function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment. The first moment of the satellite HOD can be well described by a simple power law s{$>\sptilde$}M{$\beta$} with {$\beta\sptilde$}1 for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z=0, the two-point correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fitted by a power law down to \textasciitilde 100 h-1 kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. The dependence of correlation amplitude on the number density of objects is in general agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At redshifts z{$>\sptilde$}1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales, where the CF steepens because of a more pronounced one-halo component. The departures from the power law may thus be easier to detect in high-redshift galaxy surveys than at the present-day epoch. They can be used to put useful constraints on the environments and formation of galaxies. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is dangerous and is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

The distribution of halo formation times and survival times is calculated. A Monte Carlo method for constructing representative histories of merger events leading to the formation of halos of a prescribed mass is also described. From the application of these results to the age distribution of rich clusters of galaxies, it is inferred that a high value of the density parameter (greater than about 0.5) is required to reproduce the substantial fraction of rich clusters that exhibit such substructure, if this substructure only persists for a time of 0.2 t(0) after a merger, where t(0) is the present age of the universe.},

  abstract = {A halo merger tree forms the essential backbone of a semi-analytic model for galaxy formation and evolution. Recent studies have pointed out that extracting merger trees from numerical simulations of structure formation is non-trivial; different tree building algorithms can give differing merger histories. These differences should be carefully understood before merger trees are used as input for models of galaxy formation. We investigate the impact of different halo merger trees on a semi-analytic model. We find that the z = 0 galaxy properties in our model show differences between trees when using a common parameter set. The star formation history of the Universe and the properties of satellite galaxies can show marked differences between trees with different construction methods. Independently calibrating the semi-analytic model for each tree can reduce the discrepancies between the z = 0 global galaxy properties, at the cost of increasing the differences in the evolutionary histories of galaxies. Furthermore, the underlying physics implied can vary, resulting in key quantities such as the supernova feedback efficiency differing by factors of 2. Such a change alters the regimes where star formation is primarily suppressed by supernovae. Therefore, halo merger trees extracted from a common halo catalogue using different, but reliable, algorithms can result in a difference in the semi-analytic model. Given the uncertainties in galaxy formation physics, however, these differences may not necessarily be viewed as significant.},

In this work, we present a novel approach for parameterizing the degree of concentration dependence in the abundance matching method. This new parameterization provides a smooth interpolation between two commonly used matching proxies: the peak halo mass and the peak halo maximal circular velocity. This parameterization controls the amount of dependence of galaxy luminosity on halo concentration at a fixed halo mass. Effectively this interpolation scheme enables abundance matching models to have adjustable assembly bias in the resulting galaxy catalogs. With the new 400 Mpc h-1 DarkSky Simulation, whose larger volume provides lower sample variance, we further show that low-redshift two-point clustering and satellite fraction measurements from SDSS can already provide a joint constraint on this concentration dependence and the scatter within the abundance matching framework.},

For a standard cosmology and a standard stellar Initial Mass Function, only 3.5\% of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation function of stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for rp {$<$} 30h-1Mpc. Over the range 10h-1kpc {$<$} rp {$<$} 10h-1Mpc it is extremely well represented by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation function is {$\xi{_\ast}$}(r) = (r/6.1h-1Mpc)-1.84. Relative to the dark matter, the bias of the stellar mass distribution is approximately constant on large scales, but varies by a factor of five for rp {$<$} 1h-1Mpc. This behaviour is approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy formation in the concordance {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Detailed comparison suggests that a fluctuation amplitude {$\sigma$}8 {$\sim$} 0.8 is preferred to the somewhat larger value adopted in the Millennium Simulation models with which we compare our data. This comparison also suggests that observations of stellar mass autocorrelations as a function of redshift might provide a powerful test for the nature of Dark Energy.},

We use X-ray properties of these clusters to pinpoint cluster centers and estimate cluster masses. By stacking all these systems, we study the shape of the cluster luminosity function and the galaxy distribution within the clusters. We find that the galaxy profile is well described by the Navarro, Frenk, \& White (NFW) profile with a concentration parameter c\textasciitilde 3, with no evidence for cluster mass dependence of the concentration. Using this sample, whose masses span the range from 3\texttimes 1013 to 2\texttimes 1015Msolar, we confirm the existence of a tight correlation between total galaxy NIR luminosity and cluster binding mass, which indicates that NIR light can serve as a cluster mass indicator. From the observed galaxy profile, together with cluster mass profile measurements from the literature, we find that the mass-to-light ratio is a weakly decreasing function of cluster radius and that it increases with cluster mass. We also derive the mean number of galaxies within halos of a given mass, the halo occupation number. We find that the mean number scales as N\textasciitilde M0.84+/-0.04 for galaxies brighter than MK=-21, indicating that high-mass clusters have fewer galaxies per unit mass than low-mass clusters. Using published observations at high redshift, we show that higher redshift clusters have higher mean occupation numbers than nearby systems of the same mass. By comparing the luminosity function and radial distribution of galaxies in low-mass and high-mass clusters, we show that there is a marked decrease in the number density of galaxies fainter than M* as one moves to higher mass clusters; in addition, extremely luminous galaxies are more probable in high-mass clusters. We explore several processes, including tidal interactions and merging, as a way of explaining the variation in galaxy population with cluster mass.},

  abstract = {We study the behaviour of multiple radiative-cooling algorithms implemented in seven semianalytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation, including a new model we propose in this paper. We use versions of the models without feedback and apply them to dark matter haloes growing in a cosmological context, which have final virial masses that range from 1011 to 1014 M . First, using simplified smoothly growing halo models, we demonstrate that the different algorithms predict cooling rates and final cold gas masses that differ by a factor of {$\sim$}5 for massive haloes ({$\geq$}1012 M ). The algorithms are in better agreement for less massive haloes because they cool efficiently and, therefore, their cooling rates are largely limited by the halo accretion rate. However, for less massive haloes, all the SAMs predict less cooling than corresponding 1D hydrodynamic models. Secondly, we study the gas-accretion history of the central galaxies of dark matter haloes using merger trees. The inclusion of mergers alters the cooling history of haloes by locking up gas in galaxies within small haloes at early times. For realistic halo models, the dispersion in the cold gas mass predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for high-mass haloes and 0.1 dex for low-mass haloes, while the dispersion in the accretion rate is about two times larger. Comparing to cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations, we find that most SAMs systematically underpredict the gas-accretion rates for low-mass haloes but overpredict the gas-accretion rates for massive haloes. Although the models all include both `rapid'- and `slow'-mode accretion, the transition between the two accretion modes varies between models and also differs from the simulations. Finally, we construct a new phenomenological model that explicitly incorporates cold halo gas and a gradual transition between the cold and hot modes of gas accretion to illustrate that such a class of models can better match the results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The large dispersion in cooling rates between different SAMs influences parameter choices for other galaxy physics, including star formation and feedback. Therefore, careful parametrizations of the multimode gas cooling and accretion mechanisms in simulations are necessary to ensure that the predictions from SAMs are reliable.},

After a complete description of the numerical scheme, to demonstrate the performance, accuracy, convergence and robustness of the code, we present four different test cases designed to investigate specific aspects of radiative transfer: (i) a pure-hydrogen isothermal Str\"omgren sphere; (ii) realistic Str\"omgren spheres; (iii) multiple overlapping point sources; and (iv) shadowing of background radiation by an intervening optically thick layer. When possible, detailed quantitative comparison of the results against either analytical solutions or 1D standard photoionization codes has been made, and shows a good level of agreement. For more complicated tests the code yields physically plausible results, which could be eventually checked only by comparison with other similar codes. Finally, we briefly discuss future possible developments and cosmological applications of the code.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a significant level of discussion of the correct treatment of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) in the astrophysical community. This discussion relies largely on how the KHI test is posed and analyzed. We pose a stringent test of the initial growth of the instability. The goal is to provide a rigorous methodology for verifying a code on two-dimensional KHI. We ran the problem in the Pencil Code, Athena, Enzo, NDSPMHD, and Phurbas. A strict comparison, judgment, or ranking, between codes is beyond the scope of this work, though this work provides the mathematical framework needed for such a study. Nonetheless, how the test is posed circumvents the issues raised by tests starting from a sharp contact discontinuity yet it still shows the poor performance of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We then comment on the connection between this behavior to the underlying lack of zeroth-order consistency in SPH interpolation. We comment on the tendency of some methods, particularly those with very low numerical diffusion, to produce secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz billows on similar tests. Though the lack of a fixed, physical diffusive scale in the Euler equations lies at the root of the issue, we suggest that in some methods an extra diffusion operator should be used to damp the growth of instabilities arising from grid noise. This statement applies particularly to moving-mesh tessellation codes, but also to fixed-grid Godunov schemes.},

  abstract = {We present a new numerical method for calculating the transfer of ionizing radiation, called C2-Ray (Conservative, Causal Ray-tracing method). The transfer of ionizing radiation in diffuse gas presents a special challenge to most numerical methods which involve time- and spatial-differencing. Standard approaches to radiative transport require that grid cells must be small enough to be optically-thin while time steps are small enough that ionization fronts do not cross a cell in a single time step. This quickly becomes prohibitively expensive. We have developed an algorithm which overcomes these limitations and is, therefore, orders of magnitude more efficient. The method is explicitly photon-conserving, so the depletion of ionizing photons by bound-free opacity is guaranteed to equal the photoionizations these photons caused. As a result, grid cells can be large and very optically-thick without loss of accuracy. The method also uses an analytical relaxation solution for the ionization rate equations for each time step which can accommodate time steps which greatly exceed the characteristic ionization and ionization front crossing times. Together, these features make it possible to integrate the equation of transfer along a ray with many fewer cells and time steps than previous methods. For multi-dimensional calculations, the code utilizes shortcharacteristics ray tracing. The method scales as the product of the number of grid cells and the number of sources. C2-Ray is well-suited for coupling radiative transfer to gas and N-body dynamics methods, on both fixed and adaptive grids, without imposing additional limitations on the time step and grid spacing. We present several tests of the code involving propagation of ionization fronts in one and three dimensions, in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density fields. We compare to analytical solutions for the ionization front position and velocity, some of which we derive here for the first time. As an illustration, we apply C2-Ray to simulate cosmic reionization in three dimensional inhomogeneous cosmological density field. We also apply it to the problem of I-front trapping in a dense clump, using both a fixed and an adaptive grid.},

Once this shock has moved through the entire clump it starts to accelerate because of the `rocket effect'. This continues until the entire clump has been photo-ionized. We present an analytic model for the shock and accelerating phases and also the results of numerical simulations which include detailed microphysics. We find a good match between the analytic description and the numerical results and use the numerical results to produce some of the clump's observational characteristics at different phases of its evolution.

The method is based on a non-local VET closure computed with a hybrid characteristics scheme for ray tracing. We use a Godunov method for the hyperbolic transport of radiation with an implicit backwards-Euler temporal update to avoid the explicit time-step constraint imposed by the light-crossing time, and a fixed-point Picard iteration scheme to handle the nonlinear gas-radiation exchange term, with the two implicit update stages jointly iterated to convergence. We also develop a modified wave-speed correction method for AMR, which we find to be crucial for obtaining accurate results in the diffusion regime. We demonstrate the robustness of our scheme with a suite of pure radiation and RHD tests, and show that it successfully captures the streaming, static diffusion, and dynamic diffusion regimes and the spatial transitions between them, casts sharp shadows, and yields accurate results for rates of momentum and energy exchange between radiation and gas. A comparison between different closures for the radiation moment equations, with the Eddington approximation (0th-moment closure) and the M1 approximation (1st-moment closure), demonstrates the advantages of the VET method (2nd-moment closure) over the simpler closure schemes. VETTAM has been coupled to the AMR FLASH (magneto-)hydrodynamics code and we summarize by reporting performance features and bottlenecks of our implementation.},

The current release exploits, in addition to the static grid version of the code, the distributed infrastructure of the CHOMBO library for multidimensional parallel computations over block-structured, adaptively refined grids. We employ a conservative finite-volume approach where primary flow quantities are discretized at the cell center in a dimensionally unsplit fashion using the Corner Transport Upwind method. Time stepping relies on a characteristic tracing step where piecewise parabolic method, weighted essentially non-oscillatory, or slope-limited linear interpolation schemes can be handily adopted. A characteristic decomposition-free version of the scheme is also illustrated. The solenoidal condition of the magnetic field is enforced by augmenting the equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier providing propagation and damping of divergence errors through a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic explicit cleaning step. Among the novel features, we describe an extension of the scheme to include non-ideal dissipative processes, such as viscosity, resistivity, and anisotropic thermal conduction without operator splitting. Finally, we illustrate an efficient treatment of point-local, potentially stiff source terms over hierarchical nested grids by taking advantage of the adaptivity in time. Several multidimensional benchmarks and applications to problems of astrophysical relevance assess the potentiality of the AMR version of PLUTO in resolving flow features separated by large spatial and temporal disparities.},

Crucially, it is computationally fast enough to evolve the large cosmological volumes required to predict the 21cm power spectrum on scales that will be probed by future experiments targeting the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). Most semi-numerical models aimed at predicting the EoR 21cm signal make use of an excursion set formalism (ESF) approach, which achieves computational viability by compromising on photon conservation, constraining ionised regions to be spherical by construction, and not accounting for light-travel time. By implementing our RT method within the semi-numerical code SimFast21, we show that ARTIST predicts a significantly different evolution for the EoR ionisation field compared to the code's native ESF. In particular, ARTIST predicts a more gradual evolution of the volume-averaged ionisation fraction, and up to an order-of-magnitude difference in the ionisation power, depending on the physical parameters assumed. Its application to large-scale EoR simulations will therefore allow more physically-motivated constraints to be obtained for key EoR parameters, such as the escape fraction.},

We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation by populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good agreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions of semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and subhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation function (CF) as a function of stellar mass are in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the SDSS at z=0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong constraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can therefore predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional mass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift dependence of the SHM relation and show that, for low mass halos, the SHM ratio is lower at higher redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the stellar mass dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts that not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at all redshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for massive galaxies than for low mass ones. We present convenient fitting functions for the SHM relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass function, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.},

This multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parameterization of the stellar-to-halo mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts be reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if observational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in-situ) and accretion of stars (ex-situ). Our main results are: The peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at z = 0 to 9 per cent at z = 4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 1011.8M{$\odot$} to 1012.5M{$\odot$}. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky-Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z = 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex-situ with significant accretion of satellites at z {$<$} 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly.

  abstract = {We measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) from z = 0 - 1 using multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From PRIMUS we construct an i {$<$} 23 flux-limited sample of {$\sim$} 40, 000 galaxies at z = 0.2 - 1.0 over five fields totaling {$\approx$} 5.5 deg2, and from the SDSS we select {$\sim$} 170, 000 galaxies at z = 0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a {$\approx$} 30\% increase in the number density of {$\sim$} 1010 M{$\odot$} galaxies since z {$\approx$} 0.6, and a 10\% change in the number density of all 1011 M{$\odot$} galaxies since z {$\approx$} 1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star-formation rate, we find that the number density of {$\sim$} 1010 M{$\odot$} star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z {$\approx$} 0.6, whereas the space-density of 1011 M{$\odot$} star-forming galaxies decreases by {$\approx$} 50\% between z {$\approx$} 1 and z {$\approx$} 0. Meanwhile, the number density of {$\sim$} 1010 M{$\odot$} quiescent galaxies increases steeply towards low redshift, by a factor of {$\sim$} 2 - 3 since z {$\approx$} 0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z {$\approx$} 1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around {$\sim$} 1010.8 M{$\odot$}. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z {$<$} 1, even among massive ( 1011 M{$\odot$}) quiescent galaxies.},

  abstract = {Assuming simple dynamics for the growth of density fluctuations, we implement sixdimensional (6D) radiative transfer calculations to elucidate the effects of photon propagation during the reionization of an inhomogeneous universe. The ionizing sources are postulated to be AGN-like in this paper. The present simulations reveal that radiative transfer effects are still prominent considerably after the percolation epoch, in which patchy ionized regions connect with each other. In other words, owing to the collective opacity, the Universe does not become perfectly transparent against ionizing radiation even though strongly self-shielded regions disappear. It turns out that the inhomogeneity of the medium enhances the opacity effects and delays the end of reionization. Owing to such radiative transfer effects, the reionization in an inhomogeneous universe proceeds fairly slowly, in contrast to the prompt reionization in a homogeneous universe, and as a result the surface of reionization is not so sharply edged, but highly uneven. As a signature of the uneven surface of reionization, the cosmic IR background (CIB) radiation, which is produced by Lya photons resulting from radiative recombination, could exhibit strong anisotropies, reflecting the amplitude of density fluctuations at the reionization era. The predicted CIB intensity lies on a level of possible detection by forthcoming IR space telescope facilities.},

Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than \$r\^\{-2\}\$ near the center and steeper than \$r\^\{-2\}\$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

  abstract = {The reduced speed of light approximation is used in a variety of simulations of the epoch of reionization and galaxy formation. Its popularity stems from its ability to drastically reduce the computing cost of a simulation, by allowing the use of larger, and therefore fewer timesteps to reach a solution. It is physically motivated by the fact that ionization fronts rarely propagate faster than some fraction of the speed of light. However, no global proof of the physical validity of this approach is available, and possible artefacts resulting from this approximation therefore need to be identifited and characterized to allow its proper use. In this paper we investigate the impact of the reduced speed of light approximation on the predicted properties of the intergalactic medium. To this end we use fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamics RAMSES-CUDATON simulations of the epoch of reionization. We find that reducing the speed of light by a factor 5 (20, 100) leads to overestimating the post-reionization volume-weighted \$x\_\{HI\}\$ by a similar factor \textasciitilde 5 (20, 100) with respect to full speed of light simulations. We show that the error is driven by the hydrogen - photon chemistry. In photo-ionization equilibrium, reducing the speed of light has the same effect as artificially reducing the photon density or the reaction cross-section and leads to an underestimated ionizing flux. We confirm this interpretation by running additional simulations using a reduced speed of light in the photon propagation module, but keeping this time the full speed of light in the chemistry module. With this setup, the post-reionization neutral hydrogen fractions converge to the full speed of light value, which validates our explanation. Increasing spatial resolution beyond a cell size of 1 kpc physical, so as to better resolve Lyman-limit systems, does not significantly affect our conclusions.},

We find that this morphological evolution model can explain the distribution of elliptical galaxies in the clusters well and cannot reproduce the distribution of S0 galaxies.

These finders span a wide range of techniques and methodologies to extract and quantify substructures within a larger non-homogeneous background density (e.g. a host halo). This includes real-space-, phase-space-, velocity-space- and time-space-based finders, as well as finders employing a Voronoi tessellation, Friends-of-Friends techniques or refined meshes as the starting point for locating substructure. A common post-processing pipeline was used to uniformly analyse the particle lists provided by each finder. We extract quantitative and comparable measures for the subhaloes, primarily focusing on mass and the peak of the rotation curve for this particular study. We find that all of the finders agree extremely well in the presence and location of substructure and even for properties relating to the inner part of the subhalo (e.g. the maximum value of the rotation curve). For properties that rely on particles near the outer edge of the subhalo the agreement is at around the 20 per cent level. We find that the basic properties (mass and maximum circular velocity) of a subhalo can be reliably recovered if the subhalo contains more than 100 particles although its presence can be reliably inferred for a lower particle number limit of 20. We finally note that the logarithmic slope of the subhalo cumulative number count is remarkably consistent and {$<$}1 for all the finders that reached high resolution. If correct, this would indicate that the larger and more massive, respectively, substructures are the most dynamically interesting and that higher levels of the (sub)subhalo hierarchy become progressively less important.},

We extend the method to include multiple frequencies, both hydrogen and helium, and to model the coupled evolution of the temperature and ionization balance. We test our methods by performing a set of simulations of increasing complexity and including a small cosmological reionization run. The results are in excellent agreement with exact solutions, where available, and also with results obtained with other codes if we make similar assumptions and account for differences in the atomic rates used. We use the new implementation to illustrate the differences between simulations that compute photoheating in the grey approximation and those that use multiple frequency bins. We show that close to ionizing sources the grey approximation asymptotes to the multifrequency result if photoheating rates are computed in the optically thin limit, but that the grey approximation breaks down everywhere if, as is often done, the optically thick limit is assumed.},

The commonly encountered computationally expensive scaling with the number of light sources in the simulation is avoided by introducing a source merging procedure. The (time-dependent) radiative transfer equation is solved by tracing individual photon packets in an explicitly photon-conserving manner directly on the unstructured grid traced out by the set of SPH particles. To accomplish directed transport of radiation despite the irregular spatial distribution of the SPH particles, photons are guided inside cones. We present and test a parallel numerical implementation of traphic in the SPH code gadget-2, specified for the transport of monochromatic hydrogen-ionizing radiation.

  abstract = {We propose a heuristic model that displays the main features of realistic theories for galaxy bias. We first show that the low-order clustering statistics of the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. The quasi-linear mass correlations are in fact reproduced well by a model of independent randomly-placed haloes. The distribution of galaxies within the halo density field depends on: (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation number - the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. This second assumption is essential if small-scale galaxy correlations are to remain close to a single power law, rather than flattening in the same way as the correlations of the overall density field. These simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy correlations for a flat {$\Omega$}=0.3 model ({$\Lambda$}CDM), but not for an {$\Omega$}=1 model with the same power spectrum ({$\tau$}CDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high {$\Omega$}, and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the {$\Lambda$}CDM model is lower than that of the mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.},

Sweep is a discrete ordinates method in which the radiative transfer equation is solved under the infinite speed of light, steady state assumption by a transport sweep across the entire computational grid. Since AREPO is based on an adaptive, unstructured grid, the dependency graph induced by the sweep dependencies of the grid cells is non-trivial. In order to solve the topological sorting problem in a distributed manner, we employ a task-based-parallelism approach. The main advantage of the sweep method is that the computational cost scales only with the size of the grid and is independent of the number of sources or the distribution of sources in the computational domain, which is an advantage for radiative transfer in cosmological simulations, where there are large numbers of sparsely distributed sources. We successfully apply the code to a number of physical tests such as the expansion of H II regions, the formation of shadows behind dense objects, the scattering of light, and its behaviour in the presence of periodic boundary conditions. In addition, we measure its computational performance with a focus on highly parallel, large-scale simulations.},

  abstract = {We present a novel numerical implementation of radiative transfer in the cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation code \{\textbackslash small GADGET\}. It is based on a fast, robust and photon-conserving integration scheme where the radiation transport problem is approximated in terms of moments of the transfer equation and by using a variable Eddington tensor as a closure relation, following the `OTVET'-suggestion of Gnedin \& Abel. We derive a suitable anisotropic diffusion operator for use in the SPH discretization of the local photon transport, and we combine this with an implicit solver that guarantees robustness and photon conservation. This entails a matrix inversion problem of a huge, sparsely populated matrix that is distributed in memory in our parallel code. We solve this task iteratively with a conjugate gradient scheme. Finally, to model photon sink processes we consider ionisation and recombination processes of hydrogen, which is represented with a chemical network that is evolved with an implicit time integration scheme. We present several tests of our implementation, including single and multiple sources in static uniform density fields with and without temperature evolution, shadowing by a dense clump, and multiple sources in a static cosmological density field. All tests agree quite well with analytical computations or with predictions from other radiative transfer codes, except for shadowing. However, unlike most other radiative transfer codes presently in use for studying reionisation, our new method can be used on-the-fly during dynamical cosmological simulation, allowing simultaneous treatments of galaxy formation and the reionisation process of the Universe.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical implementation of radiative transfer based on an explicitly photon-conserving advection scheme, where radiative fluxes over the cell interfaces of a structured or unstructured mesh are calculated with a second-order reconstruction of the intensity field. The approach employs a direct discretization of the radiative transfer equation in Boltzmann form with adjustable angular resolution that, in principle, works equally well in the optically-thin and optically-thick regimes. In our most general formulation of the scheme, the local radiation field is decomposed into a linear sum of directional bins of equal solid angle, tessellating the unit sphere. Each of these 'cone fields' is transported independently, with constant intensity as a function of the direction within the cone. Photons propagate at the speed of light (or optionally using a reduced speed of light approximation to allow larger time-steps), yielding a fully time-dependent solution of the radiative transfer equation that can naturally cope with an arbitrary number of sources, as well as with scattering. The method casts sharp shadows, subject to the limitations induced by the adopted angular resolution. If the number of point sources is small and scattering is unimportant, our implementation can alternatively treat each source exactly in angular space, producing shadows whose sharpness is only limited by the grid resolution. A third hybrid alternative is to treat only a small number of the locally most luminous point sources explicitly, with the rest of the radiation intensity followed in a radiative diffusion approximation. We have implemented the method in the moving-mesh code AREPO, where it is coupled to the hydrodynamics in an operator-splitting approach that subcycles the radiative transfer alternately with the hydrodynamical evolution steps. We also discuss our treatment of basic photon sink processes relevant to cosmological reionization, with a chemical network that can accurately deal with non-equilibrium effects. We discuss several tests of the new method, including shadowing configurations in two and three dimensions, ionized sphere expansion in static and dynamic density fields and the ionization of a cosmological density field. The tests agree favourably with analytical expectations and results based on other numerical radiative transfer approximations.},

  abstract = {The IllustrisTNG project is a new suite of cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation performed with the Arepo code and updated models for feedback physics. Here we introduce the first two simulations of the series, TNG100 and TNG300, and quantify the stellar mass content of about 4000 massive galaxy groups and clusters (\$10\^\{13\} \textbackslash leq M\_\{\textbackslash rm 200c\}/M\_\{\textbackslash rm sun\} \textbackslash leq 10\^\{15\}\$) at recent times (\$z \textbackslash leq 1\$). The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intra-cluster light. The exact ICL fraction depends sensitively on the definition of a central galaxy's mass and varies in our most massive clusters between 20 to 40\% of the total stellar mass. Haloes of \$5\textbackslash times 10\^\{14\}M\_\{\textbackslash rm sun\}\$ and above have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's ( \$-3.5 {$<$} \textbackslash alpha\_\{\textbackslash rm 3D\} {$<$} -3\$). Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at \$z=0\$, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as \$\textbackslash propto (M\_\{\textbackslash rm 500c\})\^\{0.49\}\$ with a \$\textbackslash sim 0.12\$ dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the available observational constraints, even though the abundance of TNG less massive galaxies (\${$<$} 10\^\{11\}M\_\{\textbackslash rm sun\}\$ in stars) is in good agreement with the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs. The 3D sizes of massive galaxies fall too on a tight (\$\textbackslash sim\$0.16 dex scatter) power-law relation with halo mass, with \$r\^\{\textbackslash rm stars\}\_\{\textbackslash rm 0.5\} \textbackslash propto (M\_\{\textbackslash rm 500c\})\^\{0.53\}\$. Even more fundamentally, halo mass alone is a good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kpc, and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single mass measurement of the galaxy or its halo.},

TNG50 evolves 2x2160\^3 dark-matter particles and gas cells in a volume 50 comoving Mpc across. It hence reaches a numerical resolution typical of zoom-in simulations, with a baryonic element mass of 8.5x10\^4 Msun and an average cell size of 70-140 parsecs in the star-forming regions of galaxies. Simultaneously, TNG50 samples \textasciitilde 700 (6,500) galaxies with stellar masses above 10\^10 (10\^8) Msun at z=1. Here we investigate the structural and kinematical evolution of star-forming galaxies across cosmic time (0 {$<$} z {$<$} 6). We quantify their sizes, disk heights, 3D shapes, and degree of rotational vs. dispersion-supported motions as traced by rest-frame V-band light (i.e. roughly stellar mass) and by Halpha light (i.e. star-forming and dense gas). The unprecedented resolution of TNG50 enables us to model galaxies with sub-kpc half-light radii and with {$<$}300-pc disk heights. Coupled with the large-volume statistics, we characterize a diverse, redshift- and mass-dependent structural and kinematical morphological mix of galaxies all the way to early epochs. Our model predicts that for star-forming galaxies the fraction of disk-like morphologies, based on 3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time and galaxy stellar mass. Gas kinematics reveal that the vast majority of 10\^9-11.5 Msun star-forming galaxies are rotationally-supported disks for most cosmic epochs (Vmax/sigma{$>$}2-3, z{$<$}5), being dynamically hotter at earlier epochs (z{$>$}1.5). Despite large velocity dispersion at high redshift, cold and dense gas in galaxies predominantly arranges in disky or elongated shapes at all times and masses; these gaseous components exhibit rotationally-dominated motions far exceeding the collisionless stellar bodies.},

  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base {$\Lambda$}CDM" in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H\textsubscript{0} = (67.8 {$\pm$} 0.9) km s\textsuperscript{-1}Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}, a matter density parameter {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m} = 0.308 {$\pm$} 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with n\textsubscript{s} = 0.968 {$\pm$} 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of {$\tau$} = 0.066 {$\pm$} 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of z\_re=8.8\textsuperscript{+1.7}\textsubscript{-1.4}. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base {$\Lambda$}CDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find N\textsubscript{eff} = 3.15 {$\pm$} 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value N\textsubscript{eff} = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {$\sum$} m\textsubscript{{$\nu$}} \&lt; 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{K} | \&lt; 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base {$\Lambda$}CDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r\textsubscript{0.002}\&lt; 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r\textsubscript{0.002} \&lt; 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V({$\varphi$}) {$\propto$} {$\varphi$}\textsuperscript{2} potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 {$\pm$} 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base {$\Lambda$}CDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

The ability to compare the tools used to construct merger trees, namely halo finders and tree building algorithms, in an unbiased and systematic manner is critical to assess the quality of merger trees. In this paper, we present the dendrogram, a novel method to visualise merger trees, which provides a comprehensive characterisation of a halo's assembly history\textemdash tracking subhalo orbits, halo merger events, and the general evolution of halo properties. We show the usefulness of the DENDROGRAM as a diagnostic tool of merger trees by comparing halo assembly simulation analysed with three different halo finders\textemdash VELOCIRAPTOR, AHF, and ROCKSTAR\textemdash and their associated tree builders. Based on our analysis of the resulting dendrograms, we highlight how they have been used to motivate improvements to VELOCIRAPTOR.

  abstract = {We consider an expanding Friedmann cosmology containing a "gas" of self-gravitating masses. The masses condense into aggregates which (when sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales, the mass spectrum of condensations becomes "self-similar" and independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely. The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can "bootstrap" their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then isothermal "seed" masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds are the galaxies themselves. The size of clusters determines, in principle, the deceleration parameter q0 presently available data give only very broad limits, unfortunately.

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview and introduction to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics in theory and in practice. Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several `urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the `neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the NDSPMHD SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper.},

  abstract = {We present a new implementation of radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code RAMSES. The multigroup radiative transfer (RT) is performed on the AMR grid with a first-order Godunov method using the M1 closure for the Eddington tensor, and is coupled to the hydrodynamics via non-equilibrium thermochemistry of hydrogen and helium. This moment-based approach has the great advantage that the computational cost is independent of the number of radiative sources - it can even deal with continuous regions of emission such as bound-free emission from gas. As it is built directly into RAMSES, the RT takes natural advantage of the refinement and parallelization strategies already in place. Since we use an explicit advection solver for the radiative transport, the time-step is restricted by the speed of light - a severe limitation that can be alleviated using the so-called reduced speed of light approximation. We propose a rigorous framework to assess the validity of this approximation in various conditions encountered in cosmology and galaxy formation. We finally perform with our newly developed code a complete suite of RHD tests, comparing our results to other RHD codes. The tests demonstrate that our code performs very well and is ideally suited for exploring the effect of radiation on current scenarios of structure and galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {We provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the local universe, identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and dark matter halos and their constituent substructures in the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model using WMAP7 cosmological parameters. Predictions for the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We associate galaxies with halos and subhalos using subhalo abundance matching, performing a comprehensive analysis which investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) how much scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. The data put tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass, on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and on the underlying conditional stellar mass function. These data rule out several halo properties commonly used in abundance matching, largely because the satellite fractions in the models disagree with those data. We show that an abundance matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of \$0.20 \textbackslash pm 0.03\$ dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. This will yield important constraints for galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that the galaxy--halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for future precision studies of the dark Universe.},

Starting from the public version of Gadget-2, we included the complex treatment of the baryon physics: gas cooling, star formation law, chemical evolution and supernovae feedback. We qualified the performances of GEAR with the case of dSph galaxies. GEAR conserves the total energy budget of the systems to better than 5\% over 14 Gyr and proved excellent convergence of the results with numerical resolution. We showed that models of dSphs in a static Euclidean space, where the expansion of the universe is neglected are valid. In addition, we tackled some of the existing open questions in the field, like the stellar mass fraction of dSphs and its link with the predicted dark matter halo mass function, the effect of the supernova feedback, the spatial distribution of the stellar populations, and the origin of the diversity in star formation histories and chemical abundance patterns. Strong supernovae driven winds seem incompatible with the observed metallicities and luminosities. Despite the fact that newly formed stars are preferentially found in the galaxy central parts, turbulent motions in the gas can quickly erase any metallicity gradient. The variety in dSph properties result from a range of total masses as well as from a dispersion in central densities. The latter is also seen in the haloes emerging from a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmogony.},

Out of an original (3.4 Mpc/h)3 cosmological box, a sample of 27 systems are re-simulated from z = 70 to z = 0 using a zoom-in technique. Gas and stellar properties are confronted to the observations in the greatest details: in addition to the galaxy global properties, we investigated the model galaxy velocity dispersion profiles, half-light radii, star formation histories, stellar metallicity distributions, and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios. The formation and sustainability of the metallicity gradients and kinematically distinct stellar populations are also tackled. We show how the properties of six Local Group dwarf galaxies, NGC 6622, Andromeda II, Sculptor, Sextans, Ursa Minor and Draco are reproduced, and how they pertain to three main galaxy build-up modes. Our results indicate that the interaction with a massive central galaxy could be needed for a handful of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies only, the vast majority of the systems and their variety of star formation histories arising naturally from a {$\Lambda$}CDM framework. We find that models fitting well the local Group dwarf galaxies are embedded in dark haloes of mass between 5 \texttimes{} 108 to a few 109 M{$\odot$}, without any missing satellite problem. We confirm the failure of the abundance matching approach at the mass scale of dwarf galaxies. Some of the observed faint however gas-rich galaxies with residual star formation, such as Leo T and Leo P, remain challenging.

  abstract = {Interstellar chemistry is important for galaxy formation, as it determines the rate at which gas can cool, and enables us to make predictions for observable spectroscopic lines from ions and molecules. We explore two central aspects of modelling the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM): (1) the effects of local stellar radiation, which ionizes and heats the gas, and (2) the depletion of metals on to dust grains, which reduces the abundance of metals in the gas phase. We run high-resolution (400 M{$\odot$} per baryonic particle) simulations of isolated disc galaxies, from dwarfs to Milky Way-mass, using the FIRE galaxy formation models together with the CHIMES non-equilibrium chemistry and cooling module. In our fiducial model, we couple the chemistry to the stellar fluxes calculated from star particles using an approximate radiative transfer scheme; and we implement an empirical density-dependent prescription for metal depletion. For comparison, we also run simulations with a spatially uniform radiation field, and without metal depletion. Our fiducial model broadly reproduces observed trends in H I and H2 mass with stellar mass, and in line luminosity versus star formation rate for [C II]\$\_\{158 \textbackslash rm \{\textbackslash mu m\}\}\$, [O I]\$\_\{63 \textbackslash rm \{\textbackslash mu m\}\}\$, [O III]\$\_\{88 \textbackslash rm \{\textbackslash mu m\}\}\$, [N II]\$\_\{122 \textbackslash rm \{\textbackslash mu m\}\}\$, and H {$\alpha$}6563\AA. Our simulations with a uniform radiation field predict fainter luminosities, by up to an order of magnitude for [O III]\$\_\{88 \textbackslash rm \{\textbackslash mu m\}\}\$ and H {$\alpha$}6563\AA, while ignoring metal depletion increases the luminosity of carbon and oxygen lines by a factor {$\approx$} 2. However, the overall evolution of the galaxy is not strongly affected by local stellar fluxes or metal depletion, except in dwarf galaxies where the inclusion of local fluxes leads to weaker outflows and hence higher gas fractions.},

We present a reaction network that can be used to solve for this thermo-chemical evolution. Our model follows the evolution of all ionization states of the 11 elements that dominate the cooling rate, along with important molecules such as H2 and CO, and the intermediate molecular species that are involved in their formation (20 molecules in total). We include chemical reactions on dust grains, thermal processes involving dust, cosmic ray ionization and heating and photochemical reactions. We focus on conditions typical for the diffuse ISM, with densities of 10-2 cm-3{$\lessequivlnt$} nH{$\lessequivlnt$}104 cm-3 and temperatures of 102 K {$\lessequivlnt$} T {$\lessequivlnt$} 104 K, and we consider a range of radiation fields, including no UV radiation. In this paper, we consider only gas that is optically thin, while paper II considers gas that becomes shielded from the radiation field. We verify the accuracy of our model by comparing chemical abundances and cooling functions in chemical equilibrium with the photoionization code CLOUDY. We identify the major coolants in diffuse interstellar gas to be C II, Si II and Fe II, along with O I and H2 at densities nH {$\greaterequivlnt$} 102 cm-3. Finally, we investigate the impact of non-equilibrium chemistry on the cooling functions of isochorically or isobarically cooling gas. We find that, at T {$<$} 104 K, recombination lags increase the electron abundance above its equilibrium value at a given temperature, which can enhance the cooling rate by up to two orders of magnitude. The cooling gas also shows lower H2 abundances than in equilibrium, by up to an order of magnitude.},

We attenuate the photochemical rates by dust and by gas, including absorption by H I, H2, He I, He II and CO where appropriate. We then use this model to investigate the dominant cooling and heating processes in interstellar gas as it becomes shielded from the UV radiation. We consider a one-dimensional plane-parallel slab of gas irradiated by the interstellar radiation field, either at constant density and temperature or in thermal and pressure equilibrium. The dominant thermal processes tend to form three distinct regions in the clouds. At low column densities, cooling is dominated by ionized metals such as Si II, Fe II, Fe III and C II, which are balanced by photoheating, primarily from H I. Once the hydrogen-ionizing radiation becomes attenuated by neutral hydrogen, photoelectric dust heating dominates, while C II becomes dominant for cooling. Finally, dust shielding triggers the formation of CO and suppresses photoelectric heating. The dominant coolants in this fully shielded region are H2 and CO. The column density of the H I-H2 transition predicted by our model is lower at higher density (or at higher pressure for gas clouds in pressure equilibrium) and at higher metallicity, in agreement with previous photodissociation region models. We also compare the H I-H2 transition in our model to two prescriptions for molecular hydrogen formation that have been implemented in hydrodynamic simulations.},

This new algorithm, which we call hybrid characteristics, introduces a novel form of ray tracing that can neither be classified as long, nor as short characteristics, but which applies the underlying principles, i.e. efficient execution through interpolation and parallelizability, of both. Primary applications of the hybrid characteristics method are radiation hydrodynamics problems that take into account the effects of photoionization and heating due to point sources of radiation. The method is implemented in the hydrodynamics package FLASH. The ionization, heating, and cooling processes are modelled using the DORIC ionization package. Upon comparison with the long characteristics method, we find that our method calculates the column density with a similarly high accuracy and produces sharp and well defined shadows. We show the quality of the new algorithm in an application to the photoevaporation of multiple over-dense clumps. We present several test problems demonstrating the feasibility of our method for performing high resolution three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics calculations that span a large range of scales. Initial performance tests show that the ray tracing part of our method takes less time to execute than other parts of the calculation (e.g. hydrodynamics and adaptive mesh refinement), and that a high degree of efficiency is obtained in parallel execution. Although the hybrid characteristics method is developed for problems involving photoionization due to point sources, and in its current implementation ignores the effects of diffuse radiation and scattering, the algorithm can be easily adapted to the case of more general radiation fields.},

Thus, we reduce this highly complex system of coupled differential equations to a simple one-dimensional anisotropic walk on a graph, which is shown to be computationally very efficient. Specifically, we use a Delaunay grid, which makes it possible to combine our scheme with a new smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) variant proposed by Pelupessy et al. (2003). We establish mathematically that by increasing the number of steps we obtain the solution of the transfer equation in the limit, we show that the results of applying a two-dimensional implementation of our method with various suitable test cases agree with the analytical results, and we point out the advantages of using our method with inhomogeneous point distributions, showing examples in the progress. Hereafter, we present a supplement to our method, which can be useful in cases where the medium is optically very thin, and we conclude by stating some anticipated properties of this method in three dimensions, and announce future extensions.},

  abstract = {We discuss new constraints on the epoch of cosmic reionization and test the assumption that most of the ionizing photons responsible arose from high redshift star-forming galaxies. Good progress has been made in charting the end of reionization through spectroscopic studies of z\textasciitilde 6-8 QSOs, gamma-ray bursts and galaxies expected to host Lyman-alpha emission. However, the most stringent constraints on its duration have come from the integrated optical depth, tau, of Thomson scattering to the cosmic microwave background. Using the latest data on the abundance and luminosity distribution of distant galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we simultaneously match the reduced value tau=0.066 +/- 0.012 recently reported by the Planck collaboration and the evolving neutrality of the intergalactic medium with a reionization history within 6 {$<\sptilde$} z {$<\sptilde$} 10, thereby reducing the requirement for a significant population of very high redshift (z{$>>$}10) galaxies. Our analysis strengthens the conclusion that star-forming galaxies dominated the reionization process and has important implications for upcoming 21cm experiments and searches for early galaxies with James Webb Space Telescope.},

Physics prescriptions for gas cooling, heating, and star formation, are similar to the ones used in our previous \{\textbackslash it AGORA\} disk comparison but now account for the effects of cosmological processes. In this work, we introduce the most careful comparison yet of galaxy formation simulations run by different code groups, together with a series of four calibration steps each of which is designed to reduce the number of tunable simulation parameters adopted in the final run. After all the participating code groups successfully completed the calibration steps, we reach a suite of cosmological simulations with similar mass assembly histories down to \$z=4\$. With numerical accuracy that resolves the internal structure of a target halo, we find that the codes overall agree well with one another in e.g., gas and stellar properties, but also show differences in e.g., circumgalactic medium properties. We argue that, if adequately tested in accordance with our proposed calibration steps and common parameters, the results of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations can be robust and reproducible. New code groups are invited to join this comparison by generating equivalent models by adopting the common initial conditions, the common easy-to-implement physics package, and the proposed calibration steps. Further analyses of the simulations presented here will be in forthcoming reports from our Collaboration.},

  abstract = {We have constructed merger trees for galaxies in the Illustris Simulation by directly tracking the baryonic content of subhalos. These merger trees are used to calculate the galaxy-galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellar mass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. We demonstrate that the most appropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy-galaxy merger consists in taking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reaches its maximum stellar mass. Additionally, we avoid effects from `orphaned' galaxies by allowing some objects to `skip' a snapshot when finding a descendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined `infall' moment. Adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which are qualitatively similar to the halo-halo merger rate except for the last one: a strong correlation with redshift that evolves as {$\sim$} (1 + z)2.4-2.8, a power law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence on descendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellar masses greater than {$\sim$} 2 \texttimes{} 1011 M . These trends are consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies (M{${_\ast}$} 1010 M ), but in tension with some recent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies (M{${_\ast}$} 1011 M ), which report a nearly constant or decreasing evolution with redshift. Finally, we provide a fitting function for the galaxy-galaxy merger rate which is accurate over a wide range of stellar masses, progenitor mass ratios, and redshifts.},

Our 5 and 10 co-moving Mpc volumes resolve haloes down to the atomic cooling limit and model the interstellar medium with better than {$\approx$}10~pc resolution. The project has numerous goals in improving our understanding of reionization and making predictions for future observations. In this first paper, we study how the inclusion of binary stars in computing stellar luminosities impacts reionization, compared to a model that includes only single stars. Owing to the suppression of galaxy growth via strong feedback, our galaxies are in good agreement with observational estimates of the galaxy luminosity function. We find that binaries have a significant impact on the timing of reionization: with binaries, our boxes are 99.9 percent ionized by volume at \$z\$ {$\approx$} 7, while without them our volumes fail to reionize by \$z\$ = 6. These results are robust to changes in volume size, resolution, and feedback efficiency. The escape of ionizing radiation from individual galaxies varies strongly and frequently. On average, binaries lead to escape fractions of {$\approx$}7\textendash 10 percent, about three times higher than with single stars only. The higher escape fraction is a result of a shallower decline in ionizing luminosity with age, and is the primary reason for earlier reionization, although the higher integrated luminosity with binaries also plays a subdominant role.},

By default it uses high-order smoothing kernels and wherever gradients are needed, they are calculated via accurate matrix inversion techniques, but a more conventional formulation with kernel gradients has also been implemented for comparison purposes. We also explore a matrix inversion formulation of SPH with a symmetrization in the particle indices that is not frequently used. We find interesting advantages of this formulation in some of the tests, for example, a substantial reduction of surface tension effects for non-ideal particle setups and more accurate peak densities in Sedov blast waves. MAGMA2 uses artificial viscosity, but enhanced by techniques that are commonly used in finite-volume schemes such as reconstruction and slope limiting. While simple to implement, this approach efficiently suppresses particle noise, but at the same time drastically reduces dissipation in locations where it is not needed and actually unwanted. We demonstrate the performance of the new code in a number of challenging benchmark tests including, for example, multidimensional vorticity creating Schulz-Rinne-type Riemann problems and more astrophysical tests such as a collision between two stars to demonstrate its robustness and excellent conservation properties.},

This combines the full nonlinearity of N-body simulations with the flexibility of the semi-analytical approach. Merging history trees derived from power-law initial perturbation spectrum simulations by Warren et al. are shown (1992, 1993). As an example of a galaxy formation model, these are combined with evolutionary stellar population synthesis, via simple scaling laws for star formation rates, showing that if most star formation occurs during merger-induced bursts, then a nearly flat faint-end slope of the galaxy luminosity function may be obtained in certain cases. Interesting properties of hierarchical halo formation are found. In a given model, merger rates may vary widely between individual haloes, and typically 20-30 percent of a halo's mass may be a result of the infall of uncollapsed material. Small-mass haloes continue to form; as expected, the existence of young, low-redshift, low-metallicity galaxies is consistent with hierarchical galaxy formation models.},

Radiation loss for each ion-electron pair is calculated using CLOUDY-17 data on the fly. Photoionization and charge exchange are the main processes contributing to chemical heating. The IN is fully coupled to the RT module over a large range of opacities at different frequencies. The RT module employs a method of short characteristics assuming spherical symmetry. The radiation module requires the assumption of spherical symmetry, while the IN is compatible with full 3D. We also include a simple prescription for dust opacity, grain destruction, and the dust contribution to radiation pressure. We present numerical tests to show the reliability and limitations of the new modules. We also present a post-processing tool to calculate projected column densities and emission spectra.},

  abstract = {We present realistic models for massive Population III stars and stellar populations based on non-LTE model atmospheres, recent stellar evolution tracks and up-to-date evolutionary synthesis models, with the aim to study their spectral properties, including their dependence on age, star formation history, and IMF. A comparison of plane parallel non-LTE model atmospheres and comoving frame calculations shows that even in the presence of some putative weak mass loss, the ionising spectra of metal-free populations differ little or negligibly from those obtained using plane parallel non-LTE models. As already discussed by Tumlinson \&amp; Shull (\textbackslash cite\{Tum00\}), the main salient property of Pop III stars is their increased ionising flux, especially in the He\textsuperscript{+} continuum (\&gt;54 eV). The main result obtained for individual Pop III stars is the following: due to their redward evolution off the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) the spectral hardness measured by the He\textsuperscript{+} /H ionising flux is decreased by a factor \textasciitilde{} 2 when averaged over their lifetime. If such stars would suffer strong mass loss, their spectral appearance could, however, remain similar to that of their ZAMS position. The main results regarding integrated stellar populations are: - for young bursts and the case of a constant SFR, nebular continuous emission - neglected in previous studies - dominates the spectrum redward of Lyman-alpha if the escape fraction of ionising photons out of the considered region is small or negligible. In consequence predicted emission line equivalent widths are considerably smaller than found in earlier studies, whereas the detection of the continuum is eased. Nebular line and continuous emission strongly affect the broad band photometric properties of Pop III objects; - due to the redward stellar evolution and short lifetimes of the most massive stars, the hardness of the ionising spectrum decreases rapidly, leading to the disappearance of the characteristic He Ii recombination lines after \textasciitilde{} 3 Myr in instantaneous bursts; - He II lambda 1640, H{$\alpha$} (and other) line luminosities usable as indicators of the star formation rate are given for the case of a constant SFR. For obvious reasons such indicators depend strongly on the IMF; - due to an increased photon production and reduced metal yields, the relative efficiency of ionising photon energy to heavy element rest mass production, eta , of metal-poor and metal-free populations is increased by factors of \textasciitilde{} 4 to 18 with respect to solar metallicity and for ``standard'' IMFs; - the lowest values of eta \textasciitilde{} 1.6-2.2\% are obtained for IMFs exclusively populated with high mass stars (M\textsubscript{low} \&gt;\textasciitilde{} 50 M\textsubscript{sun}). If correct, the yields dominated by pair creation SNae then predict large overabundances of O/C and Si/C compared to solar abundance ratios. Detailed results are given in tabular form and as fit formulae for easy implementation in other calculations. The predicted spectra will be used to study the detectability of Pop III galaxies and to derive optimal search strategies for such objects.},

We find that the properties of most galaxies, including their masses and sizes, are not significantly affected by the details of the hydrodynamics solver. However, the star formation rates of the most massive objects are affected by the lack of phase mixing due to spurious surface tension in the simulation using standard SPH. This affects the efficiency with which AGN activity can quench star formation in these galaxies and it also leads to differences in the intragroup medium that affect the X-ray emission from these objects. The differences that can be attributed to the hydrodynamics solver are, however, likely to be less important at lower resolution. We also find that the use of a time step limiter is important for achieving the feedback efficiency required to match observations of the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function.},

  abstract = {We present a new open-source cosmological code, called SWIFT, designed to solve the equations of hydrodynamics using a particle-based approach (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) on hybrid shared/distributed-memory architectures. SWIFT was designed from the bottom up to provide excellent strong scaling on both commodity clusters (Tier-2 systems) and Top100-supercomputers (Tier-0 systems), without relying on architecture-specific features or specialized accelerator hardware. This performance is due to three main computational approaches: (1) Task-based parallelism for shared-memory parallelism, which provides fine-grained load balancing and thus strong scaling on large numbers of cores. (2) Graph-based domain decomposition, which uses the task graph to decompose the simulation domain such that the work, as opposed to just the data, as is the case with most partitioning schemes, is equally distributed across all nodes. (3) Fully dynamic and asynchronous communication, in which communication is modelled as just another task in the task-based scheme, sending data whenever it is ready and deferring on tasks that rely on data from other nodes until it arrives. In order to use these approaches, the code had to be re-written from scratch, and the algorithms therein adapted to the task-based paradigm. As a result, we can show upwards of 60\% parallel efficiency for moderate-sized problems when increasing the number of cores 512-fold, on both x86-based and Power8-based architectures.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies  and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 {$<$} M*/M{$\odot$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* {$\greaterequivlnt$} 109 M{$\odot$} (M* {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1010 M{$\odot$} at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {We study galaxy clustering in the framework of halo models, where  gravitational clustering is described in terms of dark matter halos. At small scales, dark matter clustering statistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales, correlations are the result of combining nonlinear perturbation theory with halo biasing. Galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles of the halo they inhabit, and galaxy formation efficiency is characterized by the number of galaxies that populate a halo of given mass. This approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy power spectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, and the galaxy higher order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scales than their dark matter counterparts. Both are in qualitatively agreement with measurements in galaxy catalogs. We find that requiring the model to fit both the second- and third-order moments of the Automatic Plate Measuring Facility (APM) galaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. The data at large scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at small masses, m\textasciitilde 1010 Msolar h-1, whereas data at smaller scales require that the number of galaxies in a halo scale approximately as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-mass limit. These constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosity function or Tully-Fisher relation. We also predict the power spectrum, bispectrum, and higher order moments of the mass density field in this framework. Although halo models agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higher order Sp parameters in N-body simulations, the model assumption that halos are spherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of the bispectrum at small scales. We stress the importance of finite-volume effects in higher order statistics and show how they can be estimated in this approach.},

  abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute the non-linear power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter haloes, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlations between the haloes and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that the concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass. The galaxy power spectrum differs from the dark matter power spectrum because the pair-weighted number of galaxies does not scale with the halo mass and because most haloes harbour a central galaxy. If the pair-weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters, then the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with a slope close to the observed over several orders of magnitude in scale. Such a model also predicts a later onset of non-linear clustering in comparison with dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the cold dark matter (CDM) models with the data. A generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale-dependent and non-monotonic. This is particularly important for red or elliptical galaxies, which are preferentially found in larger mass haloes and for which the bias in the power spectrum may be scale-dependent even on large scales. Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed through galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because larger haloes host more than one galaxy. We compute predictions for the cross-correlation coefficient as a function of scale and discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum.},

In the galaxy halo mass range 3 \texttimes{} 1010 M{$\odot$} {$\leq$} Mh {$\leq$} 3 \texttimes{} 1013 M{$\odot$} the Mh\textendash Lr, Mstar\textendash Mh, and MBH\textendash Mh are well represented by a double power law, with a break at Mh,break {$\approx$} 3 \texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$}, corresponding to a mass in stars Mstar {$\sim$} 1.2 \texttimes{} 1010 M{$\odot$}, to a r{${_\ast}$}-band luminosity Lr {$\sim$} 5 \texttimes{} 109 L{$\odot$}, to a stellar velocity dispersion {$\sigma$} {$\simeq$} 88 km s-1, and to a black hole mass MBH {$\sim$} 9 \texttimes{} 106 M{$\odot$}. The {$\sigma$}\textendash Mh relation can be approximated by a single power law, though a double power law is a better representation. Although there are significant systematic errors associated to our method, the derived relationships are in good agreement with the available observational data and have comparable uncertainties. We interpret these relations in terms of the effect of feedback from supernovae and from the active nucleus on the interstellar medium. We argue that the break of the power laws occurs at a mass which marks the transition between the dominance of the stellar and the AGN feedback.},

  abstract = {Energy released by a small fraction of the baryons in the Universe, which condensed out while the intergalactic medium (IGM) was cold, dark and neutral, reheated and reionized it by redshift 6, exposing other baryons already condensed into dwarf-galaxy minihaloes to the glare of ionizing radiation. We present the first gas dynamical simulations of the photoevaporation of cosmological minihaloes overtaken by the ionization fronts which swept through the IGM during the reionization epoch in the currently favoured {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) universe, including the effects of radiative transfer. These simulations demonstrate the phenomenon of I-front trapping inside minihaloes, in which the weak, R-type fronts which travelled supersonically across the IGM decelerated when they encountered the dense, neutral gas inside minihaloes, and were thereby transformed into D-type I-fronts, preceded by shock waves. For a minihalo with virial temperature below 104 K, the I-front gradually burned its way through the minihalo which trapped it, removing all of its baryonic gas by causing a supersonic, evaporative wind to blow backwards into the IGM, away from the exposed layers of minihalo gas just behind the advancing I-front. We describe this process in detail, along with some of its observable consequences, for the illustrative case of a minihalo of total mass 107 Msolar, exposed to a distant source of ionizing radiation with either a stellar or quasar-like spectrum, after it was overtaken at redshift z= 9 by the weak, R-type I-front which ionized the IGM surrounding the source. For a source at z= 9 which emits 1056 ionizing photons per second at 1 Mpc (or, equivalently, 1052 ionizing photons per second at 10 kpc), the photoevaporation of this minihalo takes about 100-150 Myr, depending on the source spectrum, ending at about z= 7.5. Such hitherto neglected feedback effects were widespread during the reionization epoch. N-body simulations and analytical estimates of halo formation in the {$\Lambda$}CDM model suggest that sub-kpc minihaloes such as these, with virial temperatures below 104 K, were so common as to cover the sky around larger-mass source haloes and possibly dominate the absorption of ionizing photons during reionization. This means that previous estimates of the number of ionizing photons per hydrogen atom required to complete reionization which neglected this effect may be too low. Regardless of their effect on the progress of reionization, however, the minihaloes were so abundant that random lines of sight through the high-z Universe should encounter many of them, which suggests that it may be possible to observe the processes described here in the absorption spectra of distant sources.},

  abstract = {Subhalo abundance matching (a.k.a. SHAM) is a technique for populating simulated dark matter distributions with galaxies, assuming a monotonic relation between a galaxy's stellar mass or luminosity and the mass of its parent dark matter halo or subhalo. We examine the accuracy of SHAM in two cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, one of which includes momentum-driven galactic winds. The SPH simulations indeed show a nearly monotonic relation between stellar mass and halo mass provided that, for satellite galaxies, we use the mass of the subhalo at the epoch zsat when it became a satellite. In each simulation, the median relation for central and satellite galaxies is nearly identical, though a somewhat larger fraction of satellites are outliers because of stellar mass loss. SHAM-assigned masses (at z = 0 - 2), luminosities (R-band at z = 0), or star formation rates (at z = 2) have a 68\% scatter of 0.09 - 0.15 dex relative to the true simulation values. When we apply SHAM to the subhalo population of a collisionless N-body simulation with the same initial conditions as the SPH runs, we find generally good agreement for the halo occupation distributions and halo radial profiles of galaxy samples defined by thresholds in stellar mass. However, because a small fraction of SPH galaxies suffer severe stellar mass loss after becoming satellites, SHAM slightly overpopulates high mass halos; this effect is more significant for the wind simulation, which produces galaxies that are less massive and more fragile. SHAM recovers the two-point correlation function of the SPH galaxies in the no-wind simulation to better than 10\% at scales 0.1h-1Mpc {$<$} r {$<$} 10h-1Mpc. For the wind simulation, agreement is better than 15\% at r {$>$} 2h-1Mpc, but overpopulation of massive halos increases the correlation function by a factor {$\sim$} 2.5 on small scales. The discrepancy in the wind simulation is greatly reduced if we raise the stellar mass threshold from 6\texttimes 109M{$\odot$} to 3\texttimes 1010M{$\odot$}; in this case SHAM overpredicts the SPH galaxy correlation function by {$\sim$}20\% at r {$<$} 1h-1Mpc but agrees well with SPH clustering at larger scales.},

In our model, the energy emitted by accreting black holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present a comprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observational measurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as cold gas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formation rates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponential cut-off in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities at z \textasciitilde{} 0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely, quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model of self-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between BH mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies and black holes in our models, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation, stellar mass assembly, cold gas and metals. We find that models assuming the `concordance' {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass at high redshift (z {$>\sptilde$} 2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less star formation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas in quasar absorption systems at high redshift (z \textasciitilde{} 3-4).},

  abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

  abstract = {We describe the newly written code GADGET which is suitable both for cosmological simulations of structure formation and for the simulation of interacting galaxies. GADGET evolves self-gravitating collisionless fluids with the traditional N-body approach, and a collisional gas by smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5 3 107 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publicly release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We simulate the assembly of a massive rich cluster and the formation of its constituent galaxies in a flat, low-density universe. Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star-formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2.0e7 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian SPH technique, or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with adaptive mesh refinement. Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new parallel code AREPO, both in 2D and 3D. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that it provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques. (abridged)},

  abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics, but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's computing hardware. Here we discuss recent methodological progress in the GADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in timescales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial conditions generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to show how large cosmological N-body simulations are computed, how structures within such simulations can be identified with observed galaxies, and how the weak gravitational lensing effect of large scale structure introduces changes in the observed brightness of high redshift sources. We describe PKDGRAV, a fully parallel N-body code that can both spatially adapt to large ranges in particle densities, and temporally adapt to large ranges in dynamical timescales. Care has been taken to insure that the code runs efficiently on a variety of parallel architectures. This has led us to using a non-standard data structure for efficiently calculating the gravitational forces, a variant on the k-D tree, and a new method for treating periodic boundary conditions. A major problem with the interpretation of cosmological N-body simulations has always been identifying the positions and velocities of the ``galaxies'' in simulations. Observational constraints almost always concern the position and velocities of galaxies, not of the dark matter background. We present our grouping algorithm, SKID, which can identify galaxy halos independent of the environment in which the halo is found, a property that is very important given the large dynamic range in background densities present in cosmological simulations. PKDGRAV has been used to perform many very high resolution cosmological N-body simulations. We give an overview of some of the scientific program that has been enabled by this code. We present the magnification distributions due to weak lensing through all the intervening large scale structure from an observer to a source at z = 1. We show that the distribution is a highly skewed one with a shifted mode implying a slight demagnification bias and an extended tail toward high magnification. We investigate the implications of these results on the observations of high redshift type-Ia supernovae and show how these can be used to provide a new cosmological test.},

We find that single-aged stellar population models incorporating binary stars, as well as new stellar evolution and atmosphere models, can reproduce the colours and spectral indices observed in both globular clusters and quiescent galaxies. The best-fitting model populations are often younger than those derived from older spectral synthesis models and may also lie at slightly higher metallicities.},

It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a "task list" that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simplifies the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both nonrelativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higher-order time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efficiency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.},

As well as giving important insights into the growth of cosmic structure in their own right, they provide an essential backbone to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. This paper is the first in a series to arise from the SUSSING MERGER TREES Workshop in which ten different tree-building algorithms were applied to the same set of halo catalogues and their results compared. Although many of these codes were similar in nature, all algorithms produced distinct results. Our main conclusions are that a useful merger-tree code should possess the following features: (i) the use of particle IDs to match haloes between snapshots; (ii) the ability to skip at least one, and preferably more, snapshots in order to recover subhaloes that are temporarily lost during merging; (iii) the ability to cope with (and ideally smooth out) large, temporary flucuations in halo mass. Finally, to enable different groups to communicate effectively, we defined a common terminology that we used when discussing merger trees and we encourage others to adopt the same language. We also specified a minimal output format to record the results.},

(2013) compared a wide range of merger-tree-building codes. Here we test the influence of output strategies and mass resolution on tree-building. We find that, somewhat surprisingly, building the tree from more snapshots does not generally produce more complete trees; instead, it tends to shorten them. Significant improvements are seen for patching schemes which attempt to bridge over occasional dropouts in the underlying halo catalogues or schemes which combine the halofinding and tree-building steps seamlessly. The adopted output strategy does not affect the average number of branches (bushiness) of the resultant merger trees. However, mass resolution has an influence on both main branch length and the bushiness. As the resolution increases, a halo with the same mass can be traced back further in time and will encounter more small progenitors during its evolutionary history. Given these results, we recommend that, for simulations intended as precursors for galaxy formation models where of order 100 or more snapshots are analysed, the tree-building routine should be integrated with the halo finder, or at the very least be able to patch over multiple adjacent snapshots.},

We observe that the specifics of halo finding itself greatly influences the constructed merger trees. We find that the choices made to define the halo mass are of prime importance. For instance, amongst many potential options different finders select self-bound objects or spherical regions of defined overdensity, decide whether or not to include substructures within the mass returned and vary in their initial particle selection. The impact of these decisions is seen in tree length (the period of time a particularly halo can be traced back through the simulation), branching ratio (essentially the merger rate of subhaloes) and mass evolution. We therefore conclude that the choice of the underlying halo finder is more relevant to the process of building merger trees than the tree builder itself. We also report on some built-in features of specific merger tree codes that (sometimes) help to improve the quality of the merger trees produced.},

The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code (Kravtsov et al. 97), with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated to shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density LCDM universe are finally reported, with 256\^3 particles and 4.1 10\^7 cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 8192\^3. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloes temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

  abstract = {Simulations of galaxy formation follow the gravitational and hydrodynamical interactions between gas, stars and dark matter through cosmic time. The huge dynamic range of such calculations severely limits strong scaling behaviour of the community codes in use, with load-imbalance, cache inefficiencies and poor vectorisation limiting performance. The new swift code exploits task-based parallelism designed for many-core compute nodes interacting via MPI using asynchronous communication to improve speed and scaling. A graph-based domain decomposition schedules interdependent tasks over available resources. Strong scaling tests on realistic particle distributions yield excellent parallel efficiency, and efficient cache usage provides a large speed-up compared to current codes even on a single core. SWIFT is designed to be easy to use by shielding the astronomer from computational details such as the construction of the tasks or MPI communication. The techniques and algorithms used in SWIFT may benefit other computational physics areas as well, for example that of compressible hydrodynamics.

  abstract = {The HLLC (Harten-Lax-van Leer contact) approximate Riemann solver for computing solutions to hyperbolic systems by means of finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin methods is reviewed. HLLC was designed, as early as 1992, as an improvement to the classical HLL (Harten-Lax-van Leer) Riemann solver of Harten, Lax, and van Leer to solve systems with three or more characteristic fields, in order to avoid the excessive numerical dissipation of HLL for intermediate characteristic fields. Such numerical dissipation is particularly evident for slowly moving intermediate linear waves and for long evolution times. High-order accurate numerical methods can, to some extent, compensate for this shortcoming of HLL, but it is a costly remedy and for stationary or nearly stationary intermediate waves such compensation is very difficult to achieve in practice. It is therefore best to resolve the problem radically, at the first-order level, by choosing an appropriate numerical flux. The present paper is a review of the HLLC scheme, starting from some historical notes, going on to a description of the algorithm as applied to some typical hyperbolic systems, and ending with an overview of some of the most significant developments and applications in the last 25 years.},

Standard Eulerian schemes that strictly conserve total energy suffer from the high Mach number problem and proposed solutions to additionally solve the entropy or thermal energy still have their limitations. In our approach, the Eulerian conservation equations are solved in an adaptive frame moving with the fluid where Mach numbers are minimized. The moving frame approach uses a velocity decomposition technique to define local kinetic variables while storing the bulk kinetic components in a smoothed background velocity field that is associated with the grid velocity. Gravitationally induced accelerations are added to the grid, thereby minimizing the spurious heating problem encountered in cold gas flows. Separately tracking local and bulk flow components allows thermodynamic variables to be accurately calculated in both subsonic and supersonic regions. A main feature of the algorithm, that is not possible in previous Eulerian implementations, is the ability to resolve shocks and prevent spurious heating where both the pre-shock and post-shock fluid are supersonic. The hybrid algorithm combines the high-resolution shock capturing ability of the second-order accurate Eulerian TVD scheme with a low-diffusion Lagrangian advection scheme. We have implemented a cosmological code where the hydrodynamic evolution of the baryons is captured using the moving frame algorithm while the gravitational evolution of the collisionless dark matter is tracked using a particle-mesh N-body algorithm. Hydrodynamic and cosmological tests are described and results presented. The current code is fast, memory-friendly, and parallelized for shared-memory machines.},

  abstract = {Low-mass galaxies are thought to provide the bulk of the ionizing radiation necessary to reionize the Universe. The amount of photons escaping the galaxies is poorly constrained theoretically, and difficult to measure observationally. Yet it is an essential parameter of reionization models. We study in detail how ionizing radiation can leak from high-redshift galaxies. For this purpose, we use a series of high-resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations, zooming on three dwarf galaxies in a cosmological context. We find that the energy and momentum input from the supernova explosions has a pivotal role in regulating the escape fraction by disrupting dense star-forming clumps, and clearing sightlines in the halo. In the~absence of supernovae, photons are absorbed very locally, within the birth clouds of massive stars. We follow the time evolution of the escape fraction and find that it can vary by more than six orders of magnitude. This explains the large scatter in the value of the escape fraction found by previous studies. This fast variability also impacts the observability of the sources of reionization: a survey even as deep as M1500~=~-14 would miss about half of the underlying population of Lyman-continuum emitters.},

The Obelisk project is specifically designed to study the coevolution of high-redshift galaxies and quasars in an environment favouring black hole growth. In this paper, we establish the relative contribution of these two sources of radiation to reionization and their respective role in establishing and maintaining the high-redshift ionizing background. Our volume is typical of an overdense region of the Universe and displays star formation rate and black hole accretion rate densities similar to those of high-redshift protoclusters.

We revisit this issue using a modern compilation of observational data along with the best available large-scale cosmological simulation of dark matter (DM). We find that the standard cosmological model, used in conjunction with halo abundance matching (HAM) and simple dynamical corrections, fits\textemdash at least on average\textemdash all basic statistics of galaxies with circular velocities V circ {$>$} 80 km s-1 calculated at a radius of \textasciitilde 10 kpc. Our primary observational constraint is the luminosity-velocity (LV) relation\textemdash which generalizes the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations in allowing all types of galaxies to be included, and provides a fundamental benchmark to be reproduced by any theory of galaxy formation. We have compiled data for a variety of galaxies ranging from dwarf irregulars to giant ellipticals. The data present a clear monotonic LV relation from \textasciitilde 50 km s-1 to \textasciitilde 500 km s-1, with a bend below \textasciitilde 80 km s-1 and a systematic offset between late- and early-type galaxies. For comparison to theory, we employ our new {$\Lambda$}CDM "Bolshoi" simulation of DM, which has unprecedented mass and force resolution over a large cosmological volume, while using an up-to-date set of cosmological parameters. We use HAM to assign rank-ordered galaxy luminosities to the DM halos, a procedure that automatically fits the empirical luminosity function and provides a predicted LV relation that can be checked against observations. The adiabatic contraction of DM halos in response to the infall of the baryons is included as an optional model ingredient. The resulting predictions for the LV relation are in excellent agreement with the available data on both early-type and late-type galaxies for the luminosity range from Mr = -14 to Mr = -22. We also compare our predictions for the "cold" baryon mass (i.e., stars and cold gas) of galaxies as a function of circular velocity with the available observations, again finding a very good agreement. The predicted circular velocity function (VF) is also in agreement with the galaxy VF from 80 to 400 km s-1, using the HIPASS survey for late-type galaxies and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) for early-type galaxies. However, in accord with other recent results, we find that the DM halos with V circ {$<$} 80 km s-1 are much more abundant than observed galaxies with the same V circ. Finally, we find that the two-point correlation function of bright galaxies in our model matches very well the results from the final data release of the SDSS, especially when a small amount of scatter is included in the HAM prescription.},

  abstract = {Context: In the past decade or so, using numerical N-body simulations to  describe the gravitational clustering of dark matter (DM) in an expanding universe has become the tool of choice for tackling the issue of hierarchical galaxy formation. As mass resolution increases with the power of supercomputers, one is able to grasp finer and finer details of this process, resolving more and more of the inner structure of collapsed objects. This begs one to revisit time and again the post-processing tools with which one transforms particles into ``invisible'' dark matter haloes and from thereon into luminous galaxies. Aims: Although a fair amount of work has been devoted to growing Monte-Carlo merger trees that resemble those built from an N-body simulation, comparatively little effort has been invested in quantifying the caveats one necessarily encounters when one extracts trees directly from such a simulation. To somewhat revert the tide, this paper seeks to provide its reader with a comprehensive study of the problems one faces when following this route. Methods: The first step in building merger histories of dark matter haloes and their subhaloes is to identify these structures in each of the time outputs (snapshots) produced by the simulation. Even though we discuss a particular implementation of such an algorithm (called AdaptaHOP) in this paper, we believe that our results do not depend on the exact details of the implementation but instead extend to most if not all (sub)structure finders. To illustrate this point in the appendix we compare AdaptaHOP's results to the standard friend-of-friend (FOF) algorithm, widely utilised in the astrophysical community. We then highlight different ways of building merger histories from AdaptaHOP haloes and subhaloes, contrasting their various advantages and drawbacks. Results: We find that the best approach to (sub)halo merging histories is through an analysis that goes back and forth between identification and tree building rather than one that conducts a straightforward sequential treatment of these two steps. This is rooted in the complexity of the merging trees that have to depict an inherently dynamical process from the partial temporal information contained in the collection of instantaneous snapshots available from the N-body simulation. However, we also propose a simpler sequential ``Most massive Substructure Method'' (MSM) whose trees approximate those obtained via the more complicated non sequential method.

  abstract = {In this paper we present a new, essentially empirical, model for the relation between the mass of a dark matter halo/subhalo and the luminosity of a galaxy hosted in it. To estimate this, we replace the assumption of linearity between light and mass fluctuations with the assumption of monotonicity between galaxy light and halo or subhalo mass. We are enabled to proceed with this less restrictive ansatz by the availability of new, very high-resolution dark matter simulations and more detailed and comprehensive global galactic luminosity functions. We find that the relation between halo/subhalo mass and hosted galaxy luminosity is fairly well fitted by a double power law. The relation between halo mass and group luminosity has a shallower slope for an intermediate-mass region and is fairly well fitted by a two-branch function, with both branches double power laws. Both relations asymptote to L\textasciitilde M4 at low M, while at high mass the former follows L\textasciitilde M0.28 and the latter L\textasciitilde M0.9. In addition to the mass-luminosity relation, we also derive results for the occupation number, luminosity function of cluster galaxies, group luminosity function and multiplicity function. Then, using a prescription for the mass function of haloes in under/overdense regions and some further assumptions on the form of the mass density distribution function, we further derive results for biasing between mass and light and mass and galaxy number, the light distribution function and the void probability distribution. Our results for the most part seem to match well with observations and previous expectations. We feel this is a potentially powerful way of modelling the relation between halo mass and galaxy luminosity, because the main inputs are readily testable against dark matter simulation results and galaxy surveys, and the outputs are free from the uncertainties of physically modelling galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {Non-parametric, empirically based, models for associating galaxy  luminosities with halo/subhalo masses are being developed by several groups and we present here an updated version of the Vale \& Ostriker version of this model. This is based on a more accurate, self-consistent treatment of subhalo mass loss and revised results for the subhalo mass function (SHMF) to address this question anew. We find that the mass-luminosity relation, at high mass, particularly for first brightest galaxies and less so for group total, is almost independent of the actual luminosity function considered, when luminosity is scaled by the characteristic luminosity L*. Additionally, the shape of the total luminosity depends on the slope of the SHMF. For these high mass, cluster-sized haloes, we find that total luminosity scales as Ltot \textasciitilde M0.88, while the luminosity of the first brightest galaxy has a much weaker dependence on halo mass, L1 \textasciitilde{} M0.28, in good agreement with observations and previous results. At low mass, the resulting slope of the mass-luminosity relation depends strongly of the faint end slope of the luminosity function, and we obtain a steep relation, with approximately L \textasciitilde{} M4.5 for M \textasciitilde{} 1010h-1Msolar in the K band. The average number of galaxies per halo/cluster is also in very good agreement with observations, scaling as \textasciitilde M0.9. In general, we obtain a good agreement with several independent sets of observational data. Taking the model as essentially correct, we consider two additional possible sources for remaining discrepancies: problems with the underlying cosmology and with the observational mass determination. We find that, when comparing with observations and for a flat cosmology, the model tends to prefer lower values for {$\Omega$}m and {$\sigma$}8. Within the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) + Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) concordance plane of Tegmark et al., we find best agreement around {$\Omega$}m = 0.25 and {$\sigma$}8 = 0.8; this is also in very good agreement with the results of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)+2dF study of Sanchez et al. We also check on possible corrections for observed mass based on a comparison of the equivalent number of haloes/clusters. Additionally, we include further checks on the model results based on the mass-to-light ratio, the occupation number, the group luminosity function and the multiplicity function.},

Because of its strongly non-linear nature, DM substructure is typically modelled using N-body simulations, which reveal that large fractions of DM subhaloes undergo complete disruption. In this paper, we use both analytical estimates and idealized numerical simulations to investigate whether this disruption is mainly physical, due to tidal heating and stripping, or numerical (i.e. artificial). We show that, contrary to naive expectation, subhaloes that experience a tidal shock {$\Delta$}E that exceeds the subhalo's binding energy, |Eb|, do not undergo disruption, even when {$\Delta$}E/|Eb| is as large as 100. Along the same line, and contrary to existing claims in the literature, instantaneously stripping matter from the outskirts of a DM subhalo also does not result in its complete disruption, even when the instantaneous remnant has positive binding energy. In addition, we show that tidal heating due to high-speed (impulsive) encounters with other subhaloes (`harassment') is negligible compared to the tidal effects due to the host halo. Hence, we conclude that, in the absence of baryonic processes, the complete physical disruption of CDM substructure is extremely rare and that most disruption in numerical simulations therefore must be artificial. We discuss various processes that have been associated with numerical overmerging and conclude that inadequate force softening is the most likely culprit.},

In addition to {$\sim$} 10, 000 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies, we use deep ugri-band imaging to estimate photometric redshifts and stellar masses, and then statistically subtract fore- and background sources using data from the COSMOS survey. We measure the galaxy number density and stellar mass density distributions in logarithmically spaced bins over 2 orders of magnitude in radial distance from the BCGs. For projected distances in the range 0.1 {$<$} R/R200 {$<$} 2.0, we find that the stellar mass distribution is well-described by an NFW profile with a concentration of c = 2.03 {$\pm$} 0.20. However, at smaller radii we measure a significant excess in the stellar mass in satellite galaxies of about 1011 M per cluster, compared to these NFW profiles. We do obtain good fits to generalised NFW profiles with free inner slopes and to Einasto profiles. To examine how clusters assemble their stellar mass component over cosmic time, we compare this local sample to the GCLASS cluster sample at z {$\sim$} 1, which represents the approximate progenitor sample of the low-z clusters. This allows for a direct comparison, which suggests that the central parts (R{$<$}0.4 Mpc) of the stellar mass distributions of satellites in local galaxy clusters are already in place at z {$\sim$} 1, and contain sufficient excess material for further BCG growth. Evolving towards z = 0, clusters appear to assemble their stellar mass primarily onto the outskirts, making them grow in an inside-out fashion.},

  abstract = {For simulations of fluid dynamics in astrophysics, physical viscosity and diffusion are typically neglected. However, in this high Reynolds number regime, real fluids become highly turbulent and turbulent processes mediate substantial transport of momentum and heat that is diffusive in nature. In the absence of models for these processes, code-dependent numerical effects dominate how diffusion operates and may lead to physically incorrect simulation results. We highlight the qualitative difference in these numerical effects for smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based Eulerian codes using two test problems: a buoyant gas bubble and gas in a galaxy cluster. Grid codes suffer from numerical diffusion in the absence of explicit terms, and small-scale diffusion of heat is completely absent in the Lagrangian SPH method. We find that SPH with heat diffusion added at a level similar to that expected from turbulence diffusion generates more physically appealing results. These results suggest, but do not confirm, that a flat entropy core is to be expected for gas in an idealized galaxy cluster (i.e. one without physics beyond that of a non-radiating gas). A goal of this work is thus to draw attention to the as yet unfulfilled need for models of turbulent diffusive processes in compressible gases in astrophysics.},

For each model, we make predictions for the LBG overdensity distribution, the variance of counts in cells, the correlation length, and close pair statistics. Models that assume a one-to-one relationship between massive dark matter halos and galaxies are disfavored by close pair statistics, as are models in which colliding halos are associated with galaxies in a simplified way. However, when modeling of gas consumption and star formation is included using a semianalytic treatment, the quiescent and collisional starburst models predict similar clustering properties and none of these models can be ruled out based on the available clustering data. None of the ``realistic'' models predict a strong dependence of clustering amplitude on the luminosity threshold of the sample, in apparent conflict with some observational results.},

While the dense halo environment rapidly strips subhalos of their dark mass, the compact luminous material can remain intact for some time, making the correspondence of galaxies with severely stripped subhalos unclear. Many galaxy evolution models assume that satellite galaxies eventually merge with their central galaxy, but this ignores the possibility of satellite tidal disruption. We use a high-resolution N -body simulation of cosmological volume to explore satellite galaxy merging/disruption criteria based on dark matter subhalo dynamics. We explore the impact that satellite merging/disruption has on the Halo Occupation Distribution and radial profile of the remnants. Using abundance matching to assign stellar mass/luminosity to subhalos, we compare with observed galaxy clustering, satellite fractions, cluster satellite luminosity functions, finding that subhalos reproduce well these observables. Our results imply that satellite subhalos corresponding to {$>$} 0.2 L{${_\ast}$} galaxies must be well-resolved down to 1 - 3\% of their mass at infall to robustly trace the galaxy population. We also explore a simple analytic model based on dynamical friction for satellite galaxy infall, finding good agreement with our subhalo catalog and observations.},

The algorithm is a photon-conserving method that correctly tracks the position of I-fronts at much lower resolutions than nonconservative techniques. The method applies direct hierarchical updates to the ionic species, bypassing the need for the costly matrix solutions required by implicit methods while retaining sufficient accuracy to capture the true evolution of the fronts. We review the physics of ionization fronts in power-law density gradients, whose analytical solutions provide excellent validation tests for radiation coupling schemes. The advantages and potential drawbacks of direct and implicit schemes are also considered, with particular focus on problem time-stepping, which if not properly implemented can lead to morphologically plausible I-front behavior that nonetheless departs from theory. We also examine the effect of radiation pressure from very luminous central sources on the evolution of I-fronts and flows.},

  abstract = {We develop analytic methods for studying the formation of galaxies by gas condensation within massive dark halos. Our scheme applies to cosmogonies where structure grows through hierarchical clustering of a mixture of gas and dissipationless dark matter. It is an elaboration of the ideas of White \& Rees. We adopt the simplest models consistent with our current understanding of N-body work on dissipationless clustering, and of numerical and analytic work on gas evolution and cooling. We also employ standard models for the evolution of stellar populations, and construct new models for the way star formation heats and enriches the surrounding gas. Although our approach is phenomenological, we avoid assumptions which have no clear physical basis. Our methods allow us to predict star formation as a function of location and time, and so the following properties of the galaxy population: current star formation rates and halo X-ray luminosities; current luminosity functions both for galaxies and for virialized systems; relations between present luminosity, circular velocity, metallicity, and stellar or total M/L ratio; the history of the OB star contribution to the metagalactic ionizing flux; and the distribution of faint blue (star-forming) galaxies in both apparent magnitude and redshift. In this paper we give detailed results only for a cold dark matter universe with \{OMEGA\}=1 and H\_0\_=50 km s\^-1\^ Mpc\^-1\^, although our methods are easily applied to other models. Even for this case, predictions depend strongly on the mean baryon density, on the fluctuation amplitude, on the models for heating and metal enrichment by massive stars, and on the initial mass function with which stars form. Our most successful models require a large baryon fraction (\{OMEGA\}\_b\_/\{OMEGA\} \textasciitilde{$>$} 0.1) and efficient heating and enrichment of halo gas. They then approximately reproduce the characteristic luminosities of galaxies and of galaxy clusters, the observed relations between galaxy properties and the kind of bias needed to reconcile \{OMEGA\} = 1 with the observed kinematics of galaxy clustering. However, the amplitude of this bias is too small, and additional sources of bias must be invoked. Our luminosity functions contain significantly more faint galaxies than are observed. This is a serious discrepancy which may be alleviated by starbursts in dwarf galaxies, by selective merging of such systems, and by observational selection against low surface brightness dwarfs. Successful models form their stars late, typically more than half of them since z = 1, making the epoch of galaxy formation easily accessible to observation.},

We find that metal-enriched star formation is not restricted to atomic cooling (Tvir 104 K) haloes, but can occur in haloes down to masses {$\sim$} 106M , especially in neutral regions. Even though these smallest galaxies only host up to 104M of stars, they provide nearly 30 per cent of the ionising photon budget. We find that the galaxy luminosity function flattens above MUV {$\sim$} -12 with a number density that is unchanged at z 10.

  abstract = {Modern cosmological simulations of reionization often treat the radiative transfer by solving for the monopole and dipoles of the intensity field and by making some ansatz for the quadrupole moments to close the system of equations. We investigate the accuracy of the most common closure methods, i.e. Eddington tensor choices. We argue that these algorithms are the most likely to err after reionization and study qausi-analytic test problems that mimic these situations: large-scale fluctuations in the post-reionization ionizing background and radiative transfer in a predominantly ionized medium with discrete absorbers. We show that the usual closure methods, OTVET and M1, over-ionize self-shielding absorbers when fixing the background photoionization rate, leading to 30-40\% higher emissivity to balance the increased recombination rate. This over-ionization results in a simulation run with these algorithms having a factor of \textasciitilde{} 2 lower average metagalactic photoionization rate relative to truth for a given ionizing emissivity. Furthermore, these algorithms are unlikely to reproduce fluctuations in the ionizing background on scales below the photon mean path: OTVET tends to overpredict the fluctuations there when the simulation box is smaller than twice the mean free path and underpredict otherwise, while M1 drastically underpredicts these fluctuations. As a result, these numerical methods are likely not sufficiently accurate to interpret the Ly{$\alpha$} forest opacity fluctuations observed after reionzation. We also comment on ray tracing methods, showing that a high number of angular directions need to be followed to capture fluctuations in the post-reionization ionizing background accurately. Lastly, we argue that the strong dependence of the post-reionization ionizing background on the value of the reduced speed of light found in many simulations signals that the ionizing photon mean free path is several times larger in such simulations than the observationally measured value.},

  abstract = {Cosmic reionization is thought to be primarily fueled by the first generations of galaxies. We examine their stellar and gaseous properties, focusing on the star formation rates and the escape of ionizing photons, as a function of halo mass, redshift, and environment using the full suite of the \{\textbackslash it Renaissance Simulations\} with an eye to provide better inputs to global reionization simulations. This suite, carried out with the adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo, is unprecedented in terms of their size and physical ingredients. The simulations probe overdense, average, and underdense regions of the universe of several hundred comoving Mpc\$\^3\$, each yielding a sample of over 3,000 halos in the mass range \$10\^7 - 10\^\{9.5\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash Ms\$ at their final redshifts of 15, 12.5, and 8, respectively. In the process, we simulate the effects of radiative and supernova feedback from 5,000 to 10,000 metal-free (Population III) stars in each simulation. We find that halos as small as \$10\^7\textasciitilde\textbackslash Ms\$ are able to form stars due to metal-line cooling from earlier enrichment by massive Population III stars. However, we find such halos do not form stars continuously. Using our large sample, we find that the galaxy-halo occupation fraction drops from unity at virial masses above \$10\^\{8.5\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash Ms\$ to \$\textbackslash sim\$50\textbackslash\% at \$10\^8 \textasciitilde\textbackslash Ms\$ and \$\textbackslash sim\$10\textbackslash\% at \$10\^7\textasciitilde\textbackslash Ms\$, quite independent of redshift and region. Their average ionizing escape fraction is \$\textbackslash sim\$5\textbackslash\% in the mass range \$10\^8 - 10\^9\textasciitilde\textbackslash Ms\$ and increases with decreasing halo mass below this range, reaching 40--60\textbackslash\% at \$10\^7\textasciitilde\textbackslash Ms\$. Interestingly, we find that the escape fraction varies between 10--20\textbackslash\% in halos with virial masses \$\textbackslash sim 3 \textbackslash times 10\^9\textasciitilde\textbackslash Ms\$. Taken together, our results confirm the importance of the smallest galaxies as sources of ionizing radiation contributing to the reionization of the universe.},

  abstract = {The observability of Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) during the Epoch of Reionization can provide a sensitive probe of the evolving neutral hydrogen gas distribution, thus setting valuable constraints to distinguish different reionization models. In this study, we utilize the new THESAN suite of large-volume (95.5 cMpc) cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to directly model the Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ emission from individual galaxies and the subsequent transmission through the intergalactic medium. THESAN combines the AREPO-RT radiation-hydrodynamic solver with the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model and includes high- and medium-resolution simulations designed to investigate the impacts of halo-mass-dependent escape fractions, alternative dark matter models, and numerical convergence. We find important differences in the Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ transmission based on reionization history, bubble morphology, frequency offset from line centre, and galaxy brightness. For a given global neutral fraction, Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ transmission reduces slightly when low mass haloes dominate reionization over high mass haloes. Furthermore, the variation across sightlines for a single galaxy is greater than the variation across all galaxies. This collectively affects the visibility of LAEs, directly impacting observed Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ luminosity functions (LFs). We employ Gaussian Process Regression using SWIFTEmulator to rapidly constrain an empirical model for dust escape fractions and emergent spectral line profiles to match observed LFs. We find that dust strongly impacts the Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ transmission and covering fractions of \$M\_\{UV\} {$<$} -19\$ galaxies in \$M\_\{vir\} {$>$} 10\^\{11\} \{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ haloes, such that the dominant mode of removing Ly\$\textbackslash alpha\$ photons in non-LAEs changes from low IGM transmission to high dust absorption around \$z \textbackslash sim 7\$.},

We find that the standard SHAM connecting the luminosity of galaxies to the maximum circular velocity of subhalos well reproduces the luminosity dependence of redshift-space clustering of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a wide range of scales from 0.3 to 40 Mpc/h. The result indicates that the SHAM approach is very promising for establishing a theoretical model of redshift-space galaxy clustering without additional parameters. We also test color abundance matching using two different proxies for colors: subhalo age and local dark matter density following the method by Masaki et al. (2013b). Observed clustering of red galaxies exhibits much stronger Fingers-of-God effect than blue galaxies. We find that the subhalo age model describes the observed color-dependent redshift-space clustering much better than the local dark matter density model. The result infers that the age of subhalos is a key ingredient to determine the color of galaxies.},

Starting from the number density of dark matter haloes predicted by current models of structure formation, we seek the form of {$\Phi$}(L|M) that reproduces the galaxy luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of the galaxy clustering strength. We test the models of {$\Phi$}(L|M) by comparing the resulting mass-to-light ratios with constraints from the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation and from galaxy clusters. A comparison between model predictions and current observations yields a number of stringent constraints on both galaxy formation and cosmology. In particular, this method can break the degeneracy between {$\Omega$}0 and the power-spectrum normalization {$\sigma$}8, inherent in current weak-lensing and cluster-abundance studies. For flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmogonies with {$\sigma$}8 normalized by recent weak gravitational lensing observations, the best results are obtained for {$\Omega$}0\textasciitilde{} 0.3; {$\Omega$}0{$<\sptilde$} 0.2 leads to too large galaxy correlation lengths, while {$\Omega$}0{$>\sptilde$} 0.4 gives too high mass-to-light ratios to match the observed TF relation. The best-fitting model for the {$\Lambda$}CDM concordance cosmology with {$\Omega$}0= 0.3 and {$\Omega\Lambda$}= 0.7 predicts mass-to-light ratios that are slightly too high to match the TF relation. We discuss a number of possible effects that might remedy this problem, such as small modifications of {$\sigma$}8 and the Hubble parameter with respect to the concordance values, the assumption that the Universe is dominated by warm dark matter, systematic errors in current observational data, and the existence of dark galaxies. We use the conditional luminosity function derived from the present data to predict several statistics about the distribution of galaxy light in the local Universe. We show that roughly 50 per cent of all light is produced in haloes less massive than 2 \texttimes{} 1012h-1 Msolar. We also derive the probability distribution P(M|L) dM that a galaxy of luminosity L resides in a halo with virial masses in the range M+/- dM/2.},

Using observations of galaxy stellar mass functions out to \$z \textbackslash sim 4\$, the conditional stellar mass function at \$z\textbackslash sim 0.1\$ obtained from SDSS galaxy group catalogues, and the two-point correlation function (2PCF) of galaxies at \$z \textbackslash sim 0.1\$ as function of stellar mass, we constrain the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos over the entire cosmic history from \$z \textbackslash sim 4\$ to the present. This relation is then used to predict the median assembly histories of different stellar mass components within dark matter halos (central galaxies, satellite galaxies, and halo stars). We also make predictions for the 2PCFs of high-\$z\$ galaxies as function of stellar mass.

The conditional stellar mass function (CSMF), which describes the stellar distribution of galaxies in halos of a given mass for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with a log-normal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. On average, there are about 3 times as many central galaxies as satellites. Among the satellite population, there are in general more red galaxies than blue ones. For the central population, the luminosity function is dominated by red galaxies at the massive end, and by blue galaxies at the low mass end. At the very low-mass end (M{${_\ast}$} 109h-2 M{$\odot$}), however, there is a marked increase in the number of red centrals. We speculate that these galaxies are located close to large halos so that their star formation is truncated by the large-scale environments. The stellar-mass function of galaxy groups is well described by a double power law, with a characteristic stellar mass at {$\sim$} 4 \texttimes{} 1010h-2 M{$\odot$}. Finally, we use the observed stellar mass function of central galaxies to constrain the stellar mass halo mass relation for low mass halos, and obtain M{${_\ast}$},c {$\propto$} Mh4.9 for Mh {$\ll$} 1011 h-1M{$\odot$}.},

  abstract = {A fundamental requirement for reionizing the Universe is that a sufficient fraction of the ionizing photons emitted by galaxies successfully escapes into the intergalactic medium. However, due to the scarcity of high-redshift observational data, the sources driving reionization remain uncertain. In this work we calculate the ionizing escape fractions (fesc) of reionization-era galaxies from the state-of-the-art THESAN simulations, which combine an accurate radiation-hydrodynamic solver (AREPO-RT) with the well-tested IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model to self-consistently simulate both small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale reionization throughout a large patch of the universe (Lbox = 95.5 cMpc). This allows the formation of numerous massive haloes (Mhalo {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1010 M{$\odot$}), which are often statistically underrepresented in previous studies but are believed to be important to achieving rapid reionization. We find that low-mass galaxies (Mstars {$\lessequivlnt$} 107 M{$\odot$}) are the main drivers of reionization above z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 7, while high-mass galaxies (Mstars {$\greaterequivlnt$} 108 M{$\odot$}) dominate the escaped ionizing photon budget at lower redshifts. We find a strong dependence of fesc on the effective star-formation rate (SFR) surface density defined as the SFR per gas mass per escape area, i.e. \$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash Sigma \}\_\textbackslash text\{SFR\} = \textbackslash text\{SFR\}/M\_\textbackslash text\{gas\}/R\_\{200\}\^2\$. The variation in halo escape fractions decreases for higher-mass haloes, which can be understood from the more settled galactic structure, SFR stability, and fraction of sightlines within each halo significantly contributing to the escaped flux. Dust is capable of reducing the escape fractions of massive galaxies, but the impact on the global fesc depends on the dust model. Finally, AGN are unimportant for reionization in THESAN and their escape fractions are lower than stellar ones due to being located near the centres of galaxy gravitational potential wells.},

Both correlation functions show subtle but systematic departures from the best-fit power law, in particular a change in slope at rp\textasciitilde 1-2 h-1 Mpc. These departures are stronger for the volume-limited sample, which is restricted to relatively luminous galaxies. We show that the inflection point in wp(rp) can be naturally explained by contemporary models of galaxy clustering, according to which it marks the transition from a large-scale regime dominated by galaxy pairs in separate dark matter halos to a small-scale regime dominated by galaxy pairs in the same dark matter halo. For example, given the dark halo population predicted by an inflationary cold dark matter scenario, the projected correlation function of the volume-limited sample can be well reproduced by a model in which the mean number of Mr{$<$}-21 galaxies in a halo of mass M{$>$}M1=4.74\texttimes 1013 h-1 Msolar is M=(M/M1)0.89, with 75\% of the galaxies residing in less massive, single-galaxy halos and simple auxiliary assumptions about the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos and the fluctuations about the mean occupation. This physically motivated model has the same number of free parameters as a power law, and it fits the wp(rp) data better, with a {$\chi$}2/dof=0.93, compared to 6.12 (for 10 degrees of freedom, incorporating the covariance of the correlation function errors). Departures from a power-law correlation function encode information about the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos. Higher precision measurements of these departures for multiple classes of galaxies will constrain galaxy bias and provide new tests of the theory of galaxy formation.},

  abstract = {Methods that exploit galaxy clustering to constrain the galaxy-halo relationship, such as the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and conditional luminosity function (CLF), assume halo mass alone suffices to determine a halo's galaxy content. Yet, halo clustering strength depends upon properties other than mass, such as formation time, an effect known as assembly bias. If galaxy characteristics are correlated with these auxiliary halo properties, the basic assumption of standard HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for assembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation statistics. We construct realistic mock galaxy catalogues that exhibit assembly bias as well as companion mock catalogues with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We fit HODs to the galaxy clustering in each catalogue. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs describe the true HODs well, validating the methodology. However, in all cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs exhibit significant systematic errors. We conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy clustering is subject to significant systematic errors induced by assembly bias. Efforts to model and/or constrain assembly bias should be priorities as assembly bias is a threatening source of systematic error in galaxy evolution and precision cosmology studies.},
